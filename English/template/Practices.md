i have been feeling a lot of panic and  fear about this  talk and not just for the normal reasons  of public speaking although that's there  too but it's also because I want to say  something meaningful and I've been  overwhelmed by the enormity of what is  happening right  now and there's a particular set of  circumstance irstances which have also  been feeding into my confusion and  denial and that is because the last time  that I stood on this stage it led to a  three-year legal  battle culminated in London's high  court in which it felt like I was on  trial for my life because I was  my career my reputation my finances even  my home was on the  line all because I came  here to warn you that I didn't think  democracy was going to survive the  technology that you're building however  incredible it is in fact I was the  person who almost didn't survive and  pretty much everything that I was  warning about is now coming true  i can't sugarcoat it it's a bit of a  head  i have a lot of emotions about  coming here and Ted also I suspect is  feeling them too but what actually I  finally realized yesterday is that the  denial and the confusion that I've been  feeling is maybe what you're feeling  too i felt powerless for a really long  time so if that's what you're feeling I  get it but we have to act now my alarm  system is ringing  again there are things that we can  do in my case I survived and you will  too but it's by learning how to fight  back this is my guide and it has to  start with naming  it it's a coup i know you probably don't  want to hear that and especially here  but we can't fight it if we can't see it  and we can't see it if we don't name  it the Russian and American presidents  are now speaking the same words  they are telling the same  lies we are watching the collapse of the  international order in real time and  this is just the  start coups are like concrete when they  stop moving they  set it is already later than we think  this image some of you in this room  might know these people i call it tech  bros in hostage situations it's a  message to you this is Putin's  playbook he allows a business elite to  make untold riches in exchange for  absolute  loyalty some people are calling this  oligarchy but it it's actually bigger  than  that these are global  platforms it's brolyarchy there is an alignment of interests that  runs from through Silicon Valley to what  is now a coming  autocracy it's a type of power that the  world has never seen  before it's always the  data it's the crack cocaine of Silicon  Valley you know you know the first thing  that Elon Musk did was to send his cyber  troops into the US Treasury to get  access to the data that is not a  coincidence it's a hack that data is now  feeding AIs that are choosing who to  sack and who to replace sorry eliminate  fraud and  waste when we broke the Cambridge  Analytica story about the harvesting 87  million people's Facebook data people  freaked out  rightly this is chicken feed compared to  that but it is the  blueprint it's always the  data which is why it's so important you  start thinking about your private life  the broligarchy doesn't want you to have  one this is the old headquarters of the  East German secret  police they kept detailed files on  almost one in three of their  citizens that is nothing compared to  what Google has on every single one of  us and hundreds of other  companies the entire business model of  Silicon Valley is surveillance  it harvests our data in order to sell us  stuff we are already living inside the  architecture of  totalitarianism it may not have been  deliberate but we now have to start  acting as if we live in East  Germany and Instagram is the stary  politics is downstream from culture so I  actually learned this from one of  somebody who I think of as one of the  great philosophers of our  age Steve  Bannon he actually stole it from  somebody  else but it's not politicians who have  the power he knows that it's why he's a  podcast bro these  days but culture now is just what's next  on your phone and that's AI culture is  AI now and forget the killer robots if  you want to know what the f the first  great AI apocalypse is we're already  living it it's total information  collapse  and if you take one thing only away from  this  talk it's politics is technology  now and that's why everybody in this  room you can't look  away it's why your CEOs have been taken  captive and are paraded on TV like  hostages but you you have a  choice so Trump he calls the press the  enemies of the people and he probably  doesn't even know that he's quoting  Stalin so what happened to me is a  playbook and it's now coming for all  sorts of other people it was actually a  friend of this guy who came after me  this is Nigel Farage it's a Brexit funer  i'm not going to go super into the  details but 20 19 sorry 19 press freedom  organizations called the lawsuit against  me a slap that means it's a strategic  litigation against public  participation a really long-winded way  of saying it's using law as a weapon to  shut people up not just journalists but  other public people too and it works  i just wanted to tell you about one  aspect of the litigation which I found  terrifying and that was the data  harvesting there's this quote you may  know it's Cardinal Risheler if you give  me six lines written by the hand of the  most honest of men I will find something  in them in which will hang him  in my case the first forensic searches  of my phone and laptop yielded 40,000  pieces of  data it was my messages my  emails my voice memos my personal life  and the whole thing about this the  attack which came from me was really  personal because the thing about this  litigation isn't is only one part of the  playbook there was also this sort of  massive online campaign of  abuse which is just day after  day after day after day because my most  unforgivable crime was reporting while  female it was a digital witch  burning and I believe that this man came  after me personally not as the guardian  and not Ted was because I looked like  the weakest  leap but he was  wrong  and 30,000 people rose up to support me  they contributed almost a million pounds  to a legal defense fund because they saw  a bully trying to crush me and they  would not let it  stand and it always makes me emotional  when I think about that i just heard  somebody was saying the camera person I  don't know where they are contributed  this whole talk is actually my gratitude  towards everybody who did  that but it's also why I know about what  we have to do next you know Trump is  suing news organizations and every day  they're settling these are big  corporates with corporate interests not  everybody can stand up to power but that  there are people who are doing it and we  can support them we have to have each  other's backs right now because we are  the cavalry now  you know this is really important to me  but I spoke to a UK liel lawyer before  this  talk i want to say that there is an  awful lot of facts set down in a high  court judgment and we're actually taking  the case now to the European Court of  Human Rights we're testing the UK on its  laws around freedom of  expression so look after facts you'll  miss them when they've gone this is way  back machine give them money they're  trying to preserve the internet as it's  being deleted day by  day history is our best chance of  getting out of  this you know you probably know this  phrase do not obey in advance that's Tim  Snyder who's a historian of  authoritarianism we now are in techno  authoritarianism we have to learn how to  digitally disobey that can be as simple  as the drop-own box don't accept the  cookies don't give your real name  download Signal the encrypted messaging  app don't bomb Yemen don't add the  editor of the Atlantic to your group  chats oh don't experiment on children  you know social moors change we don't  send children down coal mines anymore  and in years to come allowing your child  to be data harvested from birth will be  considered child  abuse you didn't know but now you do  privacy is  power and we have more of it than we  think i I had this little epiphany  yesterday in which I realized actually  the moments when I felt most powerless  were the moments that I felt I was  actually most powerful  it was because my journalism had  impact they want us to feel powerless  that's the plan there is so much though  that we can learn from people who've  been through this before alexe Nalli the  leader of the Russian opposition he  always talked about a beautiful Russia  of the future he painted a vision  there is a beautiful internet of the  future free from corporate capture and  data  tracking we can build it it is going to  take a movement but we can learn from  movements that there have been before us  this is my colleagues and I on strike in  December because my news organization  The Guardian decided to sell uh our  corner of it The Observer the Sunday  title and it was a battle we really  didn't need at this time and we didn't  actually win but you know you can't win  every battle but you definitely won't  win if you don't fight  so I'm gonna I want to leave you with  this this is Chat  GPT writing a TED talk in the style of  Carol  Cadwala and it is creepily plausible  but what it doesn't know because AI is  actually as dumb as a rock is that I am  going to turn to Sam Alman who is coming  here a TED speaker and say that this  does not belong to you  chat GPT has been trained on my IP my  labor my personal  data and I did not  consent you know the Guardian The  Guardian has effectively got rid of more  than a hundred journalists we actually  leave the building next week and shortly  afterwards it signed a syndication deal  with Open  AI or as I think of it it married its  rapist but I do not consent and while we  still have copyright laws in my  country government UK government is  trying to tear them up at the moment in  order to suck up to Silicon Valley and  Trump but while we have them use them  because what is happening to my industry  is happening to yours too and it's more  than theft it's a  violation data rights are human  rights in 2019 I came here and I called  out the gods of Silicon Valley  i was  wrong sam Ultman Mark  Zuckerberg Elon Musk you are not gods  you are men and you are  careless you think that by allying  yourself with an autocrat you will be  protected that's not how history works  it's not even how oligarchy works this  is Mikar Kodakovski he was an oligarch  until he was sent to Siberia to prison  for 10 years after Putin tired of  him you are sucking up to a  tyrant who is trying to destroy the laws  who made your businesses  possible you're collaborators  you're complicit in a regime of fear and  cruelty but the rest of us we all here  we have a  choice i chose to come back to TED  because I'm reclaiming my story my words  we are not  powerless the 30,000 people who  supported me proved that we are not  powerless because we know who we are and  we know what we stand for and my  question to Silicon Valley is do  you Thank you
