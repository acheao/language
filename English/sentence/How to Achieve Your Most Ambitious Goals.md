By a show of hands,           
how many of you believe        
you could replicate this image of Brad Pitt            
with just a pencil and piece of paper?  
```

```
Well, I’m going to show you                              
how to do this.
```

```
And in so doing, 
I’m going to give you the skill 
necessary to become a world-class artist. 
```

```
And it shouldn’t take more than 
about 15 seconds.
```

```
But before I do that, 
how many of you believe 
you could replicate this image 
of 
a solid gray square?
```

```
Every one of us. 
And if you can make one gray square, 
you can make two, three, nine.
```

```
Truth of the matter is, 
if you could make just one gray square, 
it’d be very difficult to argue 
that 
you couldn’t make every gray square 
necessary to replicate the image 
in its entirety.
```

```
And there you have it. 
I’ve just given you 
the skills 
necessary to become a world-class artist. 
I know what you’re thinking.
```

```
“That’s not real art, 
certainly wouldn’t make me a world-class artist”.
```

```
So let me introduce you to Chuck Close.
```

```
He’s
one of the highest-earning artists
in the entire world,
for decades,
and he creates his art
using this exact technique.
```

```
You see,  
what stands between us  
and achieving even our most ambitious dreams  
has far less to do  
with possessing some magical skill or talent,  
and far more to do  
with how we approach problems  
and make decisions to solve them.
```

```
And because of the continuous and compounding nature  
of all those millions of decisions that we face on a regular basis,  
even a marginal improvement in our process  
can have a huge impact  
on our end results.
```

```
And I’ll prove this to you  
by taking a look  
at the career of Novak Djokovic.
```

```
Back in 2004,  
when he first became a professional tennis player,  
he was ranked 680th in the world.
```

```
It wasn’t until the end of his third year  
that he jumped up  
to be ranked third in the world.
```

```
He went from making 250,000 a year to 5 million a year,  
in prize money alone,  
and of course,  
he did this  
by winning more matches.
```

```
In 2011,  
he became the number one ranked men’s tennis player 
in the world,  
started earning an average of 14 million a year  
in prize money alone,  
and winning a dominating 90% of his matches.
```

```
Now,  
here’s what’s really interesting  
about all of these very impressive statistics.  
Novak doesn’t control any of them.
```

```
What he does control  
are all the tiny little decisions  
that he needs to make correctly  
along the way  
in order to move the probability  
in favor of him  
achieving these types of results.
```

```
And we can quantify and track his progress 
in this area  
by taking a look at the percentage of points  
that he wins.
```

```
Because in tennis  
the typical point involves one to maybe three decisions,  
I like to refer to this  
as his decision success rate.
