Hey guys it's Ariannita and today we're doing a different type of video today we're going to be  


doing some shopping vocabulary at Home Depot so come along with me and let's go ahead and walk  


inside to Home Depot as you can see when you first walk in we have different aisles full of different  


things so over there is aisle one and to my left is aisle 18. let's go ahead and start off at aisle  


18 and see what they have let's start off with aisle 19 so the nice thing about coming to Home  


Depot is that if you're lost they have signs on the ceiling to help guide you for things that you  


need so with aisle 19 we have ladders so let's go ahead and pick out some letters ladders can  


be tall or really short depending on the size you want as you can see we are in aisle 19 and  


this is the very last aisle that has ladders as you can see we have ladders of different sizes  


and height this height is 32 feet it is one of the tallest sliders that they have in Home Depot  


we use ladders to climb up something such as if you want to go on top of your roof how are you  


going to get there you need to climb up and use a ladder let's see what else we can find besides  


ladders in this aisle so we have a bunch of ladders on this side of me on my right side  


and over here we have some cement and concrete so we use cement and concrete to build houses these  


are how our homes are made in the United States and these right here are called pallets so these  


pallets are used to carry heavy supplies like concrete mixtures so they are more durable for  


these mixes we have some more ladders but you know I'm really tall so sometimes I don't need a ladder  


but here is a household ladder that is called a stepladder it literally has two steps one two  


and you can just step one up if you're short but if you're tall like me you don't really need a  


ladder now moving on from aisle 19 let's go ahead and go down to the next aisle to Lumber let's go  


ahead and walk over here and look at this we have a sign that is in Spanish if you're bilingual and  


in Home Depot you can look at this sign and see and read it and hopefully you can understand



on my right we have more ladders some more step ladders that you can use in your house  


and then We're Gonna Keep On Walking and right now we have some Lumber so this is  


just a huge block rectangular block of wood that you can use to build a house now come along with  


me we're going to go towards the windows and have our final destination at the power tools



so this caught my attention so these are some firm grip gloves that you can use so we just passed the  


lumber section so these gloves would be good when you pick up a piece of lumber or pick up a piece  


of wood you want to protect your hands and prevent them from having splinters and gloves are a great  


way to protect your hands next let's go ahead and go into this aisle so what do we have here we have  


some staplers that you can use for wood these are way different from the ones in your school  


these will be more tactable to the wood panels and we'll go deeper so we do not use this in  


school this is different this is for construction use and let's move on let's go see the windows



here we have some windows and to open the windows you'll just push it up let me go to  


the other side I'm back can you see me so to open this window up you'll just unlock it and  


you'll push the window up and then now I'm going to go through the window and you can see me next  


we have this part so you might be wondering and asking yourself what are these pieces so this  


piece right here is called a garage door now as you can see in America we have big houses  


and we have big garages so this is what I would use to shop for a garage door in a garage door  


essentially is where you can keep your car or anything for storage so this house has three  


garage doors and this one only has two and you can pick different colors from white or to Brown  


come along with me to Aisle 13 where we have a bunch of tools and hand tools that we use in  


our homes so let's see what we have here we have a bunch of tool sets that you can use for your house  


again we have some gloves over here these are our mechanic tools so as you can see we have our  


wrench set that you can use to wrench in things mechanic tools we usually use in mechanical items  


like our cars our Automobiles and let's go ahead and move on over here to see what else we can find



my friend just found a hammer for me thank you Angie so we have a  


hammer that you can pound nails in not into my hand put into a piece of wood  


let's go ahead and see what else we can find Angie what is that so that is a mallet so this  


is a hammer that you Hammer Nails into pieces of wood or other things and this is a mallet  


so similar use similar thing to a hammer but it's called differently Hammer Mallet so let's  


go ahead and move on somewhere else and see what else we can find this is called a saw this saw has  


a protective covering a piece of cardboard because a saw has sharp edges used to cut wood Home Depot  


is good to cover this because when you buy it you don't want to put your hand on it and have  


it cut a saw is very sharp but you cannot see the sharpness of it just yet because we have a cover  


I'm gonna hang this saw up here where I got it from and move on to the next item



what is this this is a magnetic Box level that will level out anything so if you're hanging  


up a picture or you're putting something on the wall or cutting something this will help  


level out anything to be straight this is called a leveler which will help level out  


things when you are putting it on a wall and you can see the leveler with a little  


bubble so when the bubble is in the middle that means it's leveled out but if it's on one side  


then your picture frame or something that's hanging on the wall is not leveled out sorry



Unfortunately they kicked me out of the store because I was recording inside the store and I  


didn't know you could do that so we're going to go ahead and go home but maybe tomorrow or next week  


I can do an updated version with a work permit that will permit me to record inside and see more  


Home Depot supplies hey guys I'm back in another Home Depot because the last one they kicked me  


out I'm very passionate to make and finish this video so I'm going to be speaking a little bit  


quieter when I'm inside so come along with me to the second Home Depot and hopefully we don't get  


kicked out hey guys we're here in the light aisle as you can see hanging from the top of the ceiling  


there are different kinds of lights and different types of colors so this is tan this is black and  


we also have a blue light and to my left we have some fans so these are called indoor ceiling fans  


that will spin around in a circle to circulate the air in your living room in your kitchen or  


anywhere you want a fan in your house now let's move on to this side where we have chandeliers  


so these are called chandeliers because they are fancier versions of Lights and as you can see they  


have multiple sets of Lights which makes them unique and moving on these are different types  


of Lights these can be for outdoor areas whereas chandeliers over here are mostly used inside the  


house now moving on to the next section we have faucets these will go into your sink in  


the kitchen what you'll do is turn it on and the water will gush out the unique thing about this  


type of faucet is that this will go down so when you're washing your dishes you can move the water  


to wash the plates next we have different types of faucets over here the good thing about Home Depot  


and the nice thing about it is we have different kitchens supplies and appliances this is called  


a display so this is an actual kitchen display that you can actually buy just like it is we have  


our kitchen cabinets which you can store glasses inside or you can store your favorite juices and  


I'm going to close this cabinet and over here we have a countertop so you can pick any design of  


countertops and boards and it's a nice way to shop and design your kitchen now you may think  


that I'm in my house but in fact I'm actually in Home Depot because you can buy any appliances I  


can buy any of this and have it inside my house so this is called an island this is a kitchen island  


and you can have stools here to sit and eat at the island and like I told you before this is a  


faucet and this is the sink where you wash dishes this is called a refrigerator I'm going to open it  


up wow it's so big and I have a bottle of water in here I'm a bit thirsty so I'm gonna take one  


moving on from the fake kitchen we have here we have even more appliances that will go inside  


our kitchen so we have our oven right here and our Stove Top and we have different sizes and  


different forms of microwaves this is a microwave and they have different types of microwaves and  


stove tops over here I'm going to open up this microwave and see what they have here  


this microwave is really cool because it works as an oven and a microwave in one so you can air fry  


things in this microwave which is actually the first one I've never seen this type of microwave  


before but you can microwave items just heating it up or you can air fry and actually cook something  


inside this microwave next we have carpets in America we have a lot of carpets inside  


of our homes and carpets will go on your floor and it's a really soft material in Home Depot  


we have different tar pits and colors this color is gray and this color is tan and you can choose  


a variety of colors over here different from a carpet this is a doormat this will go in front  


of your door where you can clean your shoes before going inside of the house over here we have rugs  


so this is a huge rug that is pink and one of my favorite colors and I'm Gonna Roll it out well  


not roll it up because this has tape anyway this is a rug and it's really soft and it's  


different from a carpet because it's just only one big rectangle whereas the carpet will take  


over your whole entire floor of your house when I say you can find anything in Home Depot I mean it  


because right now you can see this is a mailbox number and you can literally find anything here  


including different types of signs open house if you're selling your house and you want a person to  


come inside your house and you also have this for sale sign which you can put in front of your house  


over here we have different types of numbers and letters as well if you want to decorate your Hail  


box and you even have a restroom sign moving on to the front door this is a front door and we  


have different types of Shades and colors of it so we have this beautiful brown but this has an  


oval glass in the middle of the door which is cool because you can see inside but right here  


it's kind of blurry so you kind of have that security measure with the door I'm going to  


open up the door and now you can see me on the other side I'm going to close it and see what  


else we have over here over here we have this sliding patio door this will go in the back of  


your house a front door like this one will go in the front of your house whereas a sliding door  


will be attached to the back of your deck it's called a sliding door because the door will slide  


and there we go I'm gonna go ahead and close that and move on over here and see what else we have



we have a couple of more windows over here of different sizes and colors now moving on to the  


next aisle we have a bunch of drills this is a drill and a drill will drill in screws to a wall  


next we have some Sanders over here my friend Angie will buy masks and use it with a sander  


because you don't want to inhale a lot of wood so putting a mask on your face is great when sanding  


we even have plants here in Home Depot but this is not an advertisement because I'm a plant lover  


but I'm going to be shopping around looking for some plants the nice thing about small plants like  


this size is that you can keep it inside of your house we even have plants that are hanging so this  


is nice if you have tall ceilings in your house because you can hang these indoors or outdoors I  


have this one in my house so I'm not going to buy it but it's a cute little tree we have a  


big tree and a small tree I finally decided on the plant I want to take home with me and this  


plant is beautiful because it has a little flower in the middle so it'll be nice okay Angie so I'm  


thinking about painting my apartment and I'm not sure what color I should choose so which one do  


you think will be good I think you should paint it gray that's my favorite color okay I was thinking  


white but I'm not sure what kind of gray were you thinking because we have so many different shades  


you're right I was thinking light gray light gray okay let's go to the light gray and see  


what we can find so I think Angie picked out the one that I'm gonna choose and paint my apartment  


with so maybe in the next video you guys will see this color in my apartment okay now in  


order to paint we need to find paint brushes so let's go over here and find some paint brushes



they have different types of sizes of paint brushes depending on the thickness that you  


want to paint with so this is a thicker paintbrush compared to this one so the thinner paint brushes  


will be good for thin areas to touch up the edges of the ceiling or the wall this is a  


paintbrush and in order to use it you need a paint cup so this is a paint cup that you'll  


use to dip your paintbrush to paint the walls Angie what do you have over there I think this  


is a paint roller this is a paint roller that we use to paint and roll the walls okay guys I'm  


finished with the Home Depot video and it's not sponsored I was just trying to show you  


guys some new vocabulary and as you can see I am recording with the workers and no one is kicking  


me out so thank you Home Depot the second Home Depot I love you guys and thank you to  


my friend Angie who helped me with this video and appeared in this video so we're all finished bye
