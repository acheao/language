All right, let's get started  with our first lesson.

These are vintage  Vanessa lessons.

The first one is about the phrase I  don't know.

You might be surprised that  there is a way to say I don't know with  no words, just sounds  what?

Well, let's watch this video to  find out how you can use I don't know.

Let's watch.

Today, you're going to  learn 20 ways to say I don't know.

First, we'll look at some polite  expressions that are great for business  or professional situations, and then  we'll take a look at some expressions  that you can use in casual daily  everyday life.

Let's start with the  polite expressions.

First, there are  five key tag expressions that you can  add to any of these I don't know  phrases, and it's going to help you to  sound more professional and more polite.

they are.

But I'll try to find out.

But  I'll double check.

But I'll look into  that and I'll get back to you and I'll  let you know.

Can you guess why these  tag expressions are so important?

If you  just tell someone, "I don't know."

Well,  you're not really showing that you care  an awful lot, but when you use these key  tag expressions, you're showing I care.

I'm gonna do some more research and I'll  let you know what I find out.

So, we're  going to be adding these tag expressions  onto all of the I don't know sentences  that we're about to talk about so that  you can remember them and use them  yourself.

If someone asks you, "Is the  meeting at 400 p.m.?"

You could say,  "I'm not sure, but I'll try to find  out."

The expression I'm not sure is  much softer and kinder than I don't  know.

So, this is really polite to use.

If somebody comes up to you and says,  "We're having a big company dinner next  week.

Can you come?"

You could say, "Let  me think about it and I'll get back to  you."

If you said just the sentence,  "Let me think about it."

It kind of  sounds like, "No, I'm definitely not  going to come."

But if you add and I'll  get back to you, it feels a little bit  more tender, a little bit more  thoughtful and polite.

If someone asks  you, "Did the marketing team send you  their numbers?"

You might say, "I can't  remember off the top of my head, but  I'll look into it and let you know."

This is a great idiom.

I don't remember  off the top of my head.

That means I  don't remember immediately.

I don't  remember right now, but I'll look into  it and let you know.

You can see how  these tag expressions can be combined to  be even more polite and give more  information.

I'll look into it and let  you know.

With that same question, did  the marketing team send you their  numbers?

You could say not as far as I  know, but I'll look into it and get back  to you.

This expression, not as far as I  know, means that you think the answer is  no, but you're not 100% sure.

So, here  you're just telling them, I'm not 100%  sure, but I'm going to look into it and  I'll get back to you.

Not as far as I  know.

What were the marketing team's  numbers from their report?

Well, I don't  want to give you the wrong answer.

So,  I'll double check and get back to you.

I'll doublech check.

That means then  maybe you have some kind of idea about  the numbers, but you don't have them  right now.

So, you could say, "I don't  want to give you the wrong answer, so  I'll double check and get back to you."

Very polite.

Do you know if the  marketing team has started their report?

Sorry, marketing team, I'm kind of  ragging on you a little bit today.

Do  you know if the marketing team has  started their report?

You could say  that's a good question, so I'll try to  find out.

That means I don't know, but I  think that your question is valid.

That's a good question, so I'll try to  find out.

Do you know if the marketing  team has started their report?

I'm not sure if I'm the best person to  answer that, but John, the marketing  manager, probably knows.

Would you like  me to ask him and get back to you?

In  this situation, I'm not the best person  to have that information, but you can  direct them towards someone who does  probably have that information, the  marketing manager.

You might notice that  at the end of this tag question, I said,  "Would you like me to ask him?"

I'm just  kind of offering this out of kindness.

Maybe the other person will say, "Oh,  no.

I can ask him."

That's fine.

But if  you want to just have an extra added  polite layer, you can offer, "Would you  like me to ask him?"

And I'll get back  to you.

Now, let's take a look at some  casual daily life ways to say, "I don't  know."

These expressions all have  slightly different implications or  feelings.

So, let's talk about each one  in detail.

Why didn't Sarah come to the  party last night?

No clue.

Not a clue.

You don't need to  add the tag expressions onto the end of  these casual phrases because you don't  really need to go out of your way to  say, "Oh, well, uh, I'll find out and  get back to you."

No, you just simply  don't have the information.

Notice also  the body language that goes with these  casual expressions.

No clue.

Not a clue.

You probably shrug  your shoulders.

That means you raise  your shoulders up and down a little bit.

No clue.

You might even put your hands  up like this.

Not a clue.

You might even  kind of wave your hands away to say,  "Nope, not a clue."

"Why didn't Sarah  come to the party last night?

Sorry if  your name's Sarah.

I'm going to be using  your name a lot."

You might say, "I  don't have the famous idea."

This means  it kind of implies that you don't know,  but also you don't really care.

The word  faint means that something is difficult  to see.

So if your pen doesn't have much  ink in it, the writing will be faint.

The words on the page will be faint.

So  in this situation, you're saying, "I  don't have the faintest idea."

That  means my ideas about where Sarah was are  very faint.

I don't see them.

I have no  idea.

Why didn't Sarah come to the party  last night?

I haven't the foggiest idea.

It's the same idea as faintest idea.

We're using the root word fog or foggy.

Sometimes in the morning there's a fog  outside and it's tough to see.

It's  difficult to see because of the fog.

In  the US, this expression feels a little  bit British like something that Sherlock  Holmes might say.

So, we usually say it  with a little smile.

And you'll also see  people drop the final word and say  simply, I haven't the foggiest.

But you  need to say it with a little humor.

I  haven't the foggiest.

Kind of with a  silly little tone in your voice because  it doesn't feel exactly serious.

It  feels a little bit funny.

Interestingly  enough, even though we say I haven't the  foggiest idea or I haven't the foggiest,  we don't drop that final word with the  previous expression.

I don't have the  faintest idea.

We never say I don't have  the faintest.

I don't know why.

Sometimes English is a little weird.

Who  knows?

Who cares?

Which is an expression  we'll talk about in just a minute.

Why  didn't Sarah come to the party last  night?

How should I know?

This  expression, how should I know, is a  little defensive.

Maybe Sarah is your  ex-girlfriend and your friend expects  you to know where she is, but you don't  know where she is.

So, you could say,  "How should I know?"

It's a little  defensive, so make sure that you use it  in the right situations.

If your car  breaks down and you're sitting in the  lobby of the mechanic shop and your  husband calls you and says, "How long do  you think the mechanic is going to  take?"

You might say, "Beats me."

This  is really casual, but it's perfect for  this situation because you have  absolutely no idea when the mechanic's  going to be done.

You're kind of a  little annoyed, too, because no one  wants to sit in the mechanic's lobby for  hours and hours.

So, you might just say,  "Beats me."

With that same question,  "How long do you think the mechanic is  gonna take?"

You might say, "I wish I  knew."

Do you see that tone in my voice?

kind of sad, kind of wistful.

You might  add a sigh.

I wish I knew.

How long do you think the  mechanic is going to take?

Who knows?

Do  you hear that tone in my voice?

It's a  little bit upset, maybe a little bit  angry.

You might even roll your eyes a  little bit.

Who knows?

Probably forever.

How long do you think the mechanic is  going to take?

I have no idea.

Okay,  maybe you have some idea.

Not 3 minutes,  not 3 days, but you don't have a  specific amount of time that he's going  to take.

So, you could say, "I have no  idea."

Great work learning how to say,  "I don't know."

in so many wonderful  ways for all of the different situations  in daily life.

Next, let's dive into the  phrase I don't like it.

It's hard to be  negative and say that we don't like  something in a lot of situations.

So, in  this lesson, you are going to learn a  lot of wonderful phrases that we really  use, including one that seems positive,  but it's actually really negative.

And  you need to know what that is, so that  if someone else says that to you, you  can accurately understand, oh, they're  telling me that they don't like it.

All  right, let's watch that lesson to find  out.

So, today I'm here to help you  politely talk about something negative.

We're going to talk about 20 expressions  that politely mean I don't like it  without actually saying those words.

I  thought about this lesson topic because  I live in the south and it's really  typical to hear a southern woman say  bless your heart.

This sounds like a  positive thing, right?

They're blessing  you.

But don't be fooled.

This is coded  southern language.

It really means oh  you're not so smart.

So, for example, if  I give a southern woman some cookies  that I made and really those cookies are  awful, she might say to me, "Oh, you  made these?

Bless your heart."

It means  that you're a nice person, but you're  not so smart, especially when it comes  to cooking.

Now, I don't recommend you  use this expression, bless your heart.

This is only for people who were born in  the south of the US.

I live in the  south, but I was born in the north, so I  feel like I can't even use this  expression.

But I wanted to share this  with you because sometimes negative  language is coded and seems like it's  positive.

So I hope that the expressions  that you learn today will help you to be  aware of what other people are saying  and maybe they're saying negative things  and you don't even know it and also to  help you use this kind of indirect  language to be more polite.

So let's get  started with the first five expressions  about how to talk about something that  you don't really like.

Let's imagine a  situation that maybe happened to me.

All  right, let's imagine that you go to a  play with your friend.

Let's say your  friend's name is Sam.

You're going to go  see a play with your friend Sam because  your other friend Sherry is in the play.

She's acting in the play.

And really,  the play is awful.

You don't understand  it.

It doesn't make any sense.

The plot,  the characters, the scenery, the story,  nothing about it is what you like.

This is pretty tough.

Maybe after the  play when you talk with Sherry, you  probably tell a white lie and say, "Oh,  it was Thank you for inviting me.

It was  nice to see what you're working on."

You  don't need to tell her the absolute  truth about what you think.

But when you  talk with your friend Sam, who you went  to see the play with, how could you talk  about your true feelings for this in  kind of a polite way, but also showing  that you didn't really like it?

Well,  you could say it was interesting.

It was eyeopening.

It was different.

It was an experience.

Do you notice with all four of these  sentences, I'm using kind of positive  words.

Interesting, eyeopening,  different, an experience.

But there's  one thing all of these sentences have in  common.

A little pause.

This is key.

It  was interesting.

If you say, "Oh, yeah,  it was interesting."

Totally different  meaning.

There's no pause.

The  inflection in your voice is very upbeat  and positive.

But if you say it was  interesting, it was eyeopening with a  little pause.

Oh, it is completely  different.

It means it was not  interesting.

It was not eye opening.

Oh,  maybe it was different, but in a bad  way.

It was an experience that I don't  want to have again.

This is a coded  language with a little pause to tell  your friend Sam, I didn't like it, but  you're not telling him that directly.

And you know what?

Sam will understand  exactly what you mean.

If you said that  to me, it was eyeopening.

I will  understand exactly what you mean.

I'll  understand that it wasn't your type of  play.

You didn't like the plot, the  characters, but you want to still be  polite.

You don't want to say, "Ugh,  that was terrible.

That was the worst  two hours of my life."

Maybe you don't  want to tell me that.

So instead, you'll  use one of these paused expressions.

You  might hear these kind of pauses used  with other positive words.

But I feel  like these four are probably the most  common that you'll hear.

You might hear  this in TV shows and movies.

And I hope  you can use it too when you experience  something that maybe you don't really  like.

If you want to be a little bit  more direct, you could add to the end of  those sentences if you know what I mean.

So, you might say, "It was an  experience, if you know what I mean."

This is much more direct.

You're telling  him, "Hey, it wasn't a good experience.

This is coded language, if you know what  I mean.

It's kind of like you're sharing  a little inside secret."

So, if you add  this to the end of your sentence, or if  you hear someone else say that, it  means, "Oh, what you heard is not  exactly what I mean.

I mean something  different."

There's another underlying  meaning here.

It was eyeopening, if you  know what I mean.

Like, wow, my eyes  were open to all of the terrible plays  in the world.

You're not saying those directly  negative sentences, but it's helping  your coded sentence be a little bit more  direct.

Now, let's go on to talk about  13 ways that you can say I don't want it  or I don't like it in a polite way.

Almost all of these sentences can be  turned to be positive as well.

Let's  imagine this situation that happens to  me all the time.

Let's imagine you go to  a restaurant with a friend and your  friend orders a beer and says, "Want to  try it?"

So, you take a little sip, but  you don't like it.

How can you express  that to your friend without saying, "I  can't believe what you're drinking.

That's so gross.

How could you drink  that?"

Maybe that's what you're  thinking.

So, how can you say it a  little bit more politely with also  telling them I don't like it?

H, you can  say, "I'm not really into it."

In this  sentence, it is the beer.

I'm not really  into this beer.

If there's something  plural, maybe there's a music group that  your friend wants you to listen to and  you don't like them, you could say, "I'm  not really into them," you can change  that last pronoun.

Why did I add really  here?

I'm not really into it.

Well, this  helps actually to scale it back to be a  little bit less strong.

It means, well,  I don't hate it, but I don't love it.

Maybe you really hate it, but you want  to just make it a little bit less  strong.

You can add really to almost all  of these sentences that we're about to  talk about.

You could also say, "I'm not  really crazy about it."

Or just, "I'm  not crazy about it."

I'm not really  crazy about it.

I'm not crazy about it.

Or that's not for me.

That's not really  for me.

That's not really for me.

Makes  it a little bit less strong.

I'm not  really a big fan of that beer.

I'm not  really a big fan of it.

Or we can make  the sentence positive and say, "Oh, I'm  a big fan of that beer.

I'm definitely  going to get some."

Or you might say a  simple sentence, "I'll pass."

Make sure  you use this hand gesture.

You're kind  of waving a little bit.

I'll pass.

You're kind of pushing it aside and it  just shows  I'll pass.

Thanks anyway.

I'm not going  to get my own.

Thanks.

I'll pass.

The  next sentence, you have to be careful  your tone of voice.

Let's say you take a  sip of the beer and they say, "Oh, do  you want me to get you one?"

You could  say, "Ah, I've had enough of it.

I've  had enough of it."

Do you see my tone of  voice here?

I'm not saying this in an  angry way.

You could say this if you  were really angry.

I've had enough of  it.

I can't believe this is still  happening.

You could say it in a really  angry way.

Or if you're just saying, I  don't want you to order me this beer  because I don't like it.

You can say it  in a lighter way.

I've had enough of it.

One sip was enough for me.

I've had  enough of it.

The next four sentences  have a similar sentence construction.

So, we're going to put them together.

You could say, "It's not up my alley."

Or we could add that word really.

It's  not really up my alley, so I'm not going  to get that beer.

You can make the  sentence positive.

Huh?

Yeah, that  that's kind of up my alley.

I think I  might get it.

If you really like  something, it's not my cup of tea.

It's  not really my cup of tea.

So, I'm not  going to get that.

It's kind of a little  odd here because we're our example is  about beer and this example, this phrase  uses tea.

So, maybe for beer, this might  be a little bit odd to use.

But let's  say you have another experience.

you're  listening to some music that a friend  wants you to listen to and you don't  really like it.

You might use this h  it's not really my cup of tea, so I  think I'm not going to listen to them  again.

With this expression, you can say  that's my cup of tea if you like  something.

But really, we hardly ever  use this.

So, you might hear people use  this, but I don't really recommend it.

It's grammatically fine.

And I'm sure  you'll hear occasionally some people use  this, but you'll most likely hear this  in the negative sense.

That's not really  my cup of tea, so I'm not going to do  it.

That's not really my cup of tea.

That's not my thing.

That's not really  my thing.

The same as the previous  sentence, you can say, "That's my  thing."

But we hardly ever use this in  the positive form.

You're most likely to  hear this, and I hope you you're most  likely to use this in the negative form.

H that beer.

Yeah, that that's not my  thing.

It's not my style.

It's not my  jam.

It's not really my style.

Eh, it's  not really my jam.

These two are slang  expressions.

So, if you're talking about  something casual, this is fine to use.

That's not my style.

Doesn't mean it has  to be about clothing.

Could just be a  type of thing.

That's not really my  style of beer.

That's not really my  style of thing.

I'm not a big fan of it.

Let's imagine that situation where your  friend lets you drink their beer and  they've been talking about how amazing  it is.

Oh, I can't wait to go to this  restaurant for you to try this beer.

It's just mindblowing.

It's incredible.

Well, you don't want to disappoint your  friend, but if you don't like it, you  probably need to tell them in some way  so that you don't have to drink a lot of  it.

You could say, "It doesn't really do  anything for me."

This sentence is very  cryptic.

It doesn't really do anything  for me.

We kind of get this image of  fireworks.

If it did something for you,  that means that you feel fireworks  inside of you.

You're so excited about  it.

But really,  this beer is nothing special to you.

So,  you could say, "It doesn't do anything  for me."

Or, "It doesn't really do  anything for me."

You could say, "I  don't really care for it.

Uh, I don't  really care for it.

I know you really  like it, but yeah, it's just not my  thing.

I don't really care for it.

If  that beer is an imperial stout, a really  heavy beer, you might say, "Yeah, I'm  not really an imperial stout person or  I'm not really a beer person."

And this  is describing in general your character.

I'm not really a dog person.

I'm not  really a cat person.

I'm not really, you  could put almost any category in there.

I'm not really a grammar person.

I'd  rather just watch movies and listen to  English in a more natural, fun way.

I'm  not really a person.

Great work learning  all of those wonderful ways to say I  don't like it.

Let's move on to our  final phrase, which is goodbye.

You will learn how to say this in a lot  of different ways, in a lot of different  situations and contexts, including why  you should really avoid saying bye-bye.

If you say bye-bye, it's seen as really  strange in some situations, and you'll  have to watch this lesson to find out  why.

All right, let's watch.

Let's get  started with the most basic.

Bye.

But by  itself, by is a little bit lonely.

I  might say, "Oh, I think my car is almost  finished at the mechanic.

I need to go.

Bye."

Doesn't that seem a little abrupt?

Maybe I need a little bit more.

You  might notice that at the end of all my  videos, I say, "Thanks so much for  learning English with me.

I'll see you  again next Friday for a new lesson here  on my YouTube channel."

What was that  expression I used?

See you the next  time.

Or we could say, "See you next  time."

This is similar to see you later.

Talk to you later.

When we say talk to  you later, this is often on the phone or  FaceTime or Skype.

When you're not  physically in a room with someone,  you're just using some kind of device to  talk to them.

You might say, "Talk to  you later."

A common reduction for see  you later is see you later.

The word you  changes to y.

See you later.

See you  later.

It sounds really natural.

Did you  notice my pronunciation for the word  later?

Does it sound like later or  later?

Sounds like a D here.

And this is common  in American English that when you have a  T with a vowel on both sides, your T is  going to change to a D.

See you later.

Later.

If you'd like to check out some  more tips about how to sound like an  American when you speak English, you can  check out this video up here and it goes  in depth to some of these ideas.

Let's  talk about a few fun ways that you can  reduce see you later to be more casual.

You could just say see you.

See you.

Notice this is the same reduction, not  see you, but see you.

See you.

Or if you  want to have a little fun, you can say  see you later alligator.

and then the  other person says, "In a while,  crocodile."

Just rhymes.

It's silly.

Or  you can make it really short and just  say, "Later."

Or you might hear some people say lers  with an s at the end.

This is just a  silly way to say it.

Or you could say,  "Catch you later."

Catch you later.

Here  again, we're reducing you to y.

Catch  you later.

It just means see you later.

Or if you want to make this even more  casual, you could say, "Catch you on the  flip side."

Flip side means technically  tomorrow, but it could just mean at  another time.

Catch you on the flip  side.

If you want to be a little bit  more formal, you could say have a good  day, have a good morning, have a good  afternoon, have a good evening,  depending on what time it is.

You could  say this to the cashier at the grocery  store, to your mother-in-law on the  phone, to your boss.

This is a pretty  common, a little bit more formal  expression that you might not want to  use with your husband as you're saying  goodbye to him because that's a a more  personal relationship.

It's common to  use multiple expressions together, like  bye, see you later, have a good day.

Really common.

What about have a good  night?

We only use this when that person  is going directly to bed.

So, this is  really common to say to your child,  "Have a good night.

Bye.

Have a good  night.

Sweet dreams."

Or if someone you  know is spending the night at your  house, you could say this because you  know they're going directly to bed.

Have  a good night.

But if you are having  dinner and drinks with your co-workers  and you are trying to say goodbye to  them and you're going home, you probably  wouldn't say have a good night.

You  might say have a good evening or you  might say have a good one.

Have a good  one.

This is generally have a good day,  but you can use this at any time during  the day.

It's a little bit more casual,  but it's no problem to use with your  boss or in other formal situations.

Have  a good one.

The next two expressions are  take it easy, take care.

I wouldn't use  these on the phone with a client, but if  it's a Friday and the day is finishing,  you're finishing up your work and you  want to say goodbye to your co-workers,  this is no problem.

You could say, "Take  care.

Take it easy."

That's a great way  to say goodbye to your co-workers.

You  could say this to someone that you are a  little bit closer to, maybe a friend.

As  your friend's leaving your house, you  could say, "Bye.

Take care.

The rest of  these expressions are all slang, casual,  funny ways to say goodbye.

So, I  recommend do not do not use these at  work.

But if someone uses this to you,  maybe you go to someone's house and they  use this or if you hear it on a TV show,  you need to know the slight nuances, the  slight specific meanings for each of  these expressions so that you know  exactly what they mean when they say  them.

Even if you don't feel comfortable  using them yourself, maybe you feel like  you're too old to use slang.

Well, it's  important to know them.

So, let's start.

Peace.

Peace out.

Usually, you make the  peace sign when you say this.

Just a  casual way to say goodbye.

Peace.

I'm  out of here.

I'm out.

Out.

If you've  ever watched a baseball game, you might  see the referee use this gesture when  one of the players is out.

So, you don't  have to use this thumb gesture.

Out.

I'm  out of here.

But it's pretty common and  you might see this.

Toodaloo.

Toodles.

This one is really silly.

Kind of ditsy,  but I don't know.

For some reason, I  love using it.

Toodles.

Bye-bye.

We only use this for children.

Please do  not do not use this with your boss  unless you want to get fired.

If you  have small children or if you interact  with small children, you might hear  other people say bye-bye, that's really  common.

I think that we often repeat  things two or three times in expressions  with kids to help them remember it.

So  when you say bye-bye, it helps them to  kind of remember that expression.

The  next three expressions are in Spanish  and French, but we use them in really  specific situations that might not be  used in their original language.

The  first one isa  vista baby.

If you use this, make sure you do that  waving gesture vista baby and you use  that same tone of voice baby.

It's just  a silly way to say goodbye to your  friends.

You don't need to use this with  your girlfriends specifically like your  baby, your love.

You could just say this  to someone who is you're in a casual  relationship with them, your friends.

Aasta vista baby.

Or you might say,  "Adios, amigos."

In Spanish, if all of  your friends are girls, you should say  amigos.

But in English, we always say  adios, amigos.

I'm sorry, Spanish  speakers.

This is incorrect Spanish, but  that's how we use it.

So, you can use  this to casually say goodbye to your  friends.

Make sure you say it with a  little bit of a laugh.

Adios, amigos.

And a little bit of a wave.

Just a fun  way to say goodbye.

Adu.

Can you tell from my tone of voice  what I'm trying to show with this?

A  great word to describe it is  melodramatic.

You're just trying to be over dramatic.

You're pretending that you won't see  your friends for a really long time, but  really you probably will.

So, let's  imagine that you're having a dinner  party and it's time for you to go.

You  might say,  "It's so serious."

So, make sure you  have that serious tone of voice, but  it's just a joke.

You're just being over  dramatic.

Farewell.

This also has that same melodramatic  feel.

You're pretending that you're  going off to war and you won't see your  friends for a long time, but really  you're just going to your house.

So, you  can say farewell  until next time.

Until the next time.

We use this to have a fake formal  feeling.

We don't use this in formal  situations.

The only time we use this is  to have a fake formal feeling.

So, let's  imagine that you're at that dinner party  with your friends and you're leaving.

You might say, "Until the next time."

Kind of pretending that you just  finished a serious business meeting and  you're telling them, "Continue the good  work, my friends.

Until the next time."

Great work learning all of those  wonderful ways to say goodbye.

Unfortunately, now it is time to say  farewell.
