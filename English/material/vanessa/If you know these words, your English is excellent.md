Haha, how great.

All  right, I hope that this worksheet will be helpful to you and let's get started  with our first real or fake English  expression.

All right, I'm going to be reading to you a little story, a few  sentences, and I want you to guess what is the best answer in the blank.

Are you  ready?

Vanessa was folding laundry when  Dan walked in holding a puppy.

Surprise,  he said.

She laughed and said, I was not  expecting that today.

Okay.

Is it Vanessa was folding laundry when out of  the blue Or was it Vanessa was folding laundry when out of the red Dan came in  holding a puppy?

I'll give you three  seconds.

Is it blue or red?

The correct answer is a.

Vanessa was  folding laundry when out of the blue Dan walked in holding a puppy.

Surprise.

This expression means suddenly without  warning.

Just poof.

There is Dan holding a puppy out of the blue.

Real or fake idiom number two is this.

Dan tried to fix the leaky sink all morning.

After hours of frustration, he looked at Vanessa and I think I need to and call a plumber.

Is it I think I need  to throw in the sponge or I think I need  to throw in the towel.

I'll give you three seconds to decide  which one is the real expression and  which one I totally made up.

The real answer is I think I need to  throw in the towel and call a plumber.

This expression to throw in the towel  means just to give up.

He tried to fix  it all morning.

It didn't work.

He got  frustrated and realized, I just need to  give up and call a professional.

Real or  fake English expression number three is  this.

Vanessa was helping Dan do his  taxes for the first time.

Don't worry,  she said.

I'll show you how to do it so  we don't miss anything.

Dan smiled and  said, that's why I need your help.

Just  for clarity's sake, I am not a tax  expert.

In fact, please do not ask me to  help you with your taxes.

I am not the  one to do that.

All right.

Is this I'll  show you how to do it by the book or  I'll show you how to do it on the shelf  so we don't miss anything.

I'll give you  three seconds to guess.

The correct answer is I'll show you how  to do it by the book so that we don't  miss anything.

This expression means to  follow the rules exactly.

Of course,  when you're doing your taxes, you should  follow the rules exactly.

Or you can use  this great phrase and say, "When you do  your taxes, you need to do everything by  the book."

Great.

The next real or fake  English expression is this one.

Dan  didn't get the job he really wanted.

At  first, he felt disappointed, but then he  found a better opportunity the next week  and told Vanessa, "I guess it was  h is it I guess it was a blessing in  disguise."

Or, "I guess it was a  blessing in a costume."

Both of these  have a similar feel.

We're talking about  hiding something.

A costume hides  something.

A disguise hides something.

But only one of these is correct.

The  other one I completely made up.

I'll  give you three seconds to guess.

Three,  two, one.

The answer is,  well, Dan told Vanessa, I guess it was a  blessing in disguise.

Make sure that  you're pronouncing this word correctly.

Disguise.

Disguise.

It was pretty frustrating to not get the  job he wanted.

But a better opportunity  happened quickly after that.

So not  getting that job, it was a blessing in  disguise.

It was something that seemed  bad at first, but really it turned out  to be good.

Great.

Real or fake English  expression number five is this.

Michelle  offered to help Vanessa clean up after  the party.

Not only did she wash the  dishes, but she also vacuumed the living  room.

Vanessa smiled and said, "You  really  Is it you really walked the extra block  or is it you really went the extra  mile?"

H, one of these I completely made  up.

Which one is it?

Three, two, one.

The correct answer is Vanessa smiled and  said, "You really went the extra mile."

Here we're talking about to do something  beyond what is necessary to go the extra  mile.

You're helping more than is  necessary.

I love it when a guest offers  to help bring the dishes to the the sink  or helps to do the dishes or offers to  clean up in some way.

That's very kind.

And in this sentence, Michelle went the  extra mile.

She tried to help more than  was necessary, but I appreciated it.

So,  tell me, how are you doing?

Are you five  for five?

What is your score?

I hope  you're keeping track.

We have five more  English expressions, plus a bonus one.

So, let's keep going.

Real or fake  English expression number six is this.

Vanessa and Dan wanted to take a  vacation, but they hadn't picked a place  yet.

Everything is still at my work, Dan  said.

Let's decide this weekend.

Is it  Everything is still down on the ground  at my work or everything is still up in  the air at my work.

H.

The correct answer is everything is  still up in the air.

This simply means  it's undecided yet.

So, there's probably  some something that has to be organized  at Dan's job in order for him to choose  which days he can go on vacation.

I  don't know.

This project is still  undecided.

We don't know the timeline  yet.

It's still up in the air at work,  so we'll have to plan our trip later.

It's still up in the air.

Real or fake  English expression number seven is a fun  one.

Listen to this.

Dan and Vanessa  were late to a meeting.

When the manager  asked what happened, Dan said it was  Vanessa's fault.

Later, Vanessa said,  "Hey, why did you like that?"

Well, is it, "Why did you throw me under  the desk like that?"

Or is it, "Why did  you throw me under the bus like that?"

Which one of these is correct?

And which  one did I just completely make up?

The real English expression is this.

Why  did you throw me under the bus like  that?

Well, it's not very kind for Dan  to tell the manager it's Vanessa's  fault.

So, he is trying to put the blame on me.

Make it so that all the negative energy  is going towards me.

It's kind of like he threw me under the  bus.

No one wants to be thrown under the bus,  right?

So, if you blame someone else to  avoid getting in trouble, you are  throwing them under the bus.

Kids do  this all the time.

Bad co-workers do  this as well.

I hope you don't throw  someone under the bus.

Real or fake  English expression number eight is this  one.

Vanessa wanted everything to be  perfect for Michelle's visit.

She cooked  her favorite meal, cleaned the guest  room, even picked fresh flowers.

"You  really for me," Michelle said with a big  smile.

"H is it you really bent over  backwards for me or you really leaned  over forward for me?"

Which one is  correct?

Which one did I just totally  make up?

The correct English expression that we  use all the time is you really bent over  backwards for me.

This is kind of  similar to going the extra mile.

You're  trying really hard to help someone.

When  you have a guest, you could just say,  "Hey, come on in.

That's great."

Or you  can try to pick some fresh flowers and  have them at the table.

Clean your house  a little bit.

Offer them something to  drink.

you are trying to bend over  backwards to help them.

All right, it's  starting to get very sunny.

So, let's finish the next two  expressions and the bonus one.

Are you  ready for number nine?

Real or fake  idiom number nine is this.

Dan and  Vanessa were working on a home  renovation project together.

Before they  started, Vanessa said, "Let's make sure  we're about what to do."

Dan nodded.

Good idea.

Is it, "Let's make sure we're  on the same page or let's make sure  we're on the same notebook."

Which one  is the real idiom?

Which one did I  completely make up?

The answer is, let's make sure we're on  the same page.

I love this expression  because it so perfectly fits in a lot of  situations.

In your workplace, you often  need to be on the same page as your  co-workers.

In your relationships, you  need to be on the same page.

You need to  make sure that you have the same ideas  and expectations about life, about the  day.

You need to be on the same page as  a lot of people in your life.

That's  really essential, right?

It just means  you understand something in the same  way.

You're on the same page.

All right,  let's go to real or fake expression  number 10.

All right, real or fake  expression number 10 is this.

Dan told  Vanessa that the meeting at work went  fine, but he didn't look happy.

She  could tell something was wrong.

I can,  she said.

Do you want to talk about it?

Is it I can read between the pages or I  can read between the lines?

H think  about this one.

Which one's real?

Which  one's fake?

The answer is I can read between the  lines.

So when Dan said the meeting was fine,  his face did not show that it was fine.

Instead his face showed it was not fine.

So here I am trying to guess what is  happening that's not being spoken.

I am  reading between the lines.

So when you  read a book there are lines of text and  usually between the lines there's  nothing written right but here in a  relationship often times what you say  has another meaning.

Maybe there's  something that you're not saying, but  you're saying with your face or with  your gestures or your body language.

So,  in this situation, I could read between  the lines and I knew Dan well enough to  know the meeting actually didn't go  well.

All right, before the sun comes  out full blast, let's go on to our bonus  real or fake English expression.

This uh  bonus expression is very fun.

Listen to  this.

Michelle didn't know how to set up  her new phone.

Vanessa helped her and  said, "Don't worry, just follow the  steps on the screen."

Is it, "Don't  worry, it's not rocket chemistry.

Just  follow the steps on the screen."

Or is  it, "Don't worry, it's not rocket  science.

Just follow the steps on the  screen."

I'll give you three seconds to  guess which one is real.

The answer is don't worry it's not  rocket science just follow the steps on  the screen.

Now sometimes the steps on  the screen are not that easy but this  expression usually we use it in the  negative form.

It's not rocket science  and it's to simplify something.

It's not  as complicated as you think.

Rocket  science.

Getting a rocket to outer space  is pretty complicated, right?

But when  you say it's not rocket science, it just  means it's easy.

You can do it.

No  problem.
