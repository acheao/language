I want to share with you a plan
to fix one of the biggest planetary
market failures of our lifetime.
It's been nearly 150 years
since Thomas Edison invented
the incandescent light bulb,
ushering in the age of electricity.
So how can it be that 700
million people on this planet
still lack access to electricity?
When the Sun goes down,
they depend on dirty,
expensive, sometimes
dangerous fuels for light.
And these are some of the most overlooked
and underestimated people on the planet.
But we can solve this problem
if we have the moral imagination
to do two things.
First, we have to rethink
how we approach risk.
And second,
we have to address the false binary
between mitigation, or reducing emissions,
and adaptation, or adjusting
to the climate crisis.
Before we talk about that, though,
let's look at what's at stake.
We know that the most vulnerable
are disproportionately
impacted by climate events.
Electricity is resilience.
It's agency.
It’s light and irrigation
and communications, and it’s cooling.
It's also basic empowerment.
We live in an age where
tech entrepreneurs are promising
that every child on the planet
will have their own AI tutor.
Unless you're a child
without access to electricity.
The good news is that, as we've discussed,
solar energy has been one of the great
success stories of the 21st century.
When my organization, Acumen,
started investing
in off-grid electricity in 2007,
1.5 billion people on the planet
had no access to electricity.
Today, that number has been cut in half.
And while off-grid
can't claim full credit,
it's been an important part of the story.
And I've had the privilege of investing in
and witnessing the evolution
of this extraordinary off-grid sector
that started off with lights,
and then we saw home systems
with radios and cell phone chargers,
and then emerged the adjacent possible.
Solar televisions and cookstoves
and solar irrigation
and refrigeration and e-mobility.
And today you can see
thousands of electric motorbikes
powering down the streets
of Kenya and Rwanda.
I've also been able to talk
to so many customers across the continent.
Like Susan, who said
that what surprised her
when she got her solar system
was that she no longer experienced
deep fear every single night.
She said, "I used to fear
bandits, wild animals, men.
Or going to the toilet,"
her external toilet --
"And being bitten by a snake."
She said, "Now I don't feel stressed.
My children and I have more connection.
And indeed, they'd finished watching
a course on their solar television
to learn sign language in Kiswahili
so that for the first time in their lives,
they were able to communicate
with their deaf cousins."
Energy is independence,
and it has great economic impact.
The average family reduces
energy spending by more than 50 percent,
and this is a sector that has created
more than 370,000 good jobs.
We as a world are on track
to reach another 300 million people
by the end of the decade.
That still leaves hundreds
of millions living in the dark.
These are the hardest to reach.
In places like Burundi,
with an 11 percent electrification rate.
Malawi, 16.
Chad, 12.
And those aren't just statistics.
Those are human beings.
And yet, too often we dismiss them
as too poor, too risky, too hard.
So let me say this clearly.
This is about our shared human dignity.
If we believe that all
human beings deserve dignity,
and we understand
that the impact of climate
will disproportionately impact
the most vulnerable amongst us,
then these are precisely the people
on whom we need to focus.
Because electricity
isn't just about light.
It's about communication during floods,
irrigation during droughts.
It's about cooling medicines
during heat waves and pandemics.
It's about hospitals
and schools, businesses,
so that isolated communities,
already fragile,
can build resilience
in an increasingly volatile climate.
Adaptation matters,
but this story has equal
urgency for mitigation.
Now today, the continent only contributes
3.5 percent of total global emissions,
and the average American consumes
about 1/15 the energy of an American.
But those are the wrong numbers
to pay attention to.
As Al Gore said, what matters
is future emissions.
The continent's population
is expected to grow
from 1.5 to 2.5 billion people by 2050.
And so the question is,
what kind of energy will fuel it?
What we've learned
from investing in off-grid
is that once families
are on the first rung
of the solar energy ladder,
they don't go back.
That's good news for the planet
and for its people.
If we just brought electricity
to 10 million families, basic level,
we would avert more than 27 million
tons of carbon looking forward
and create about 10 billion dollars
in direct economic benefit.
Multiply that and you get transformation.
But how do we do it?
The companies are here,
but the capital is not.
And one thing for certain
is that money cannot be the constraint.
Because last year, the world
allocated two trillion dollars
to transitioning industry
from fossil fuels to cleaner energy.
But less than 800 million
went to off-grid solar.
That's less than 0.1 percent.
And it makes no sense.
Because climate finance isn't scarce.
It's scared.
And maybe at first glance,
you can understand it.
Customers make a few dollars a day.
Macroeconomic headwinds,
like inflation, depreciation,
have pummeled markets.
Inequality, lack of jobs,
in some places, uncertain leadership.
OK, but if we focus only on narratives
that talk about the problem,
we miss the much bigger narrative
of the opportunity.
Electricity is foundational.
And we can solve this problem,
but we need the right kind of capital
to open up new energy markets.
And a lot of people
have been thinking for a long time
about how to do that in ways
that are more important today,
in a post-aid era.
My organization's been building
on our investing work for many years
to create a an initiative called
the Hardest-to-Reach.
It's essentially
a multi-layered capital stack
that's a blend of philanthropy,
impact investing,
funds from development
finance institutions
and a commercial bank.
It starts with 60 million
dollars in philanthropy,
so that we can take early-stage
patient capital investments
in those companies operating
in the most challenging climates.
Philanthropy lets you go fast.
So already we've invested
12 million dollars
in eight companies in Sierra Leone,
Benin, Malawi, the DRC,
and most recently, Somalia.
Side by side is a debt facility
that is impact-aligned.
It's anchored with funding from
the Green Climate Fund and others.
And again, that allows us to bring in
more institutional capital above,
including Shinhan, the largest
commercial bank in Korea.
Thus far, 21 different stakeholders
across the capital continuum,
from grants to impact to commercial,
have come together to bring
a quarter billion dollars in financing
to Africa's most challenging
energy markets.
Now making this happen hasn’t been easy.
It has relied on the leadership,
the courage
and the competence
of a whole lot of people,
including in big institutions.
But that is exactly the kind
of moral imagination that we need
to rethink the way we approach investing.
Because it is just not OK
to let financial risk have the final word.
(Applause)
If we're smart enough and careful enough,
we can offset financial risk.
But equally important,
what is the risk of not daring?
Leaving hundreds of millions
of people in the dark
and watching
instability, emissions and migration rise?
It means cutting off human potential,
possibility, creativity.
You see, risk is not
just a financial concept.
It's an environmental concept,
a social concept.
And it is most definitely a moral concept.
And so, yes, we can structure
the right kind of capital,
but we need all of the players
to go from asking,
"Am I getting the highest return,"
to, "What is the problem
we're trying to solve?
What is the capital that is needed?
And where can I play a role?”
And also if you take a long-term
investor's perspective,
think about the hundreds of millions
of new electricity consumers
that will need new appliances
and new innovations and new services.
Completely new markets will emerge.
We know this because we've seen this.
And though this is hard,
it is eminently within our reach.
In history,
there aren't that many chances
to do something as big and important
and as difficult as bringing electricity
to everyone on the planet.
But I sometimes ask myself,
in 100 years,
what will that generation say about us?
Will they gasp in astonishment and say,
we were the ones that finally
brought electricity and possibility
and human dignity to everyone?
Or will they wonder,
"How could they have averted their eyes
and left hundreds of millions behind?"
I hope they say we learned
to control capital and technology
and not be controlled by it.
I hope they say we cared,
that we did hard things.
That we loved the world.
And in doing so, we set ourselves free.
The poet Hafez wrote,
"Even after all these years,
the Sun never says to the Earth,
‘You owe me.’
Look what happens with a love like that.
It lights the whole sky."
So let's get going.
Thank you.
(Applause)
