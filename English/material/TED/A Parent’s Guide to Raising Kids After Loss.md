One of the first things I did when I started my company was make a business card.

I didn't really know what to put underneath my name.

There were only two of us doing everything.

But I figured I went to a legitimate business school.

So damn it, I'm a legitimate businessman.

And as a legitimate businessman, a CEO, people tended to ask me questions about all sorts of things, even parenting.

I'd respond quickly, firmly.

so they would believe me.

I thought I had answers.

Uh but then my wife got real sick and I learned a whole bunch more.

But but let me back up.

I come from a pretty traditional family and I used that as a blueprint when it was time to start my own.

My wife Liz and I got married in 2001 and we had three healthy kids in rapid succession with me in the office and her at home.

I I know not all families look like this, but but ours did.

And for about eight years, it was a dream.

Shortly after she turned 40, the kids were two, four, and six.

She was diagnosed with ovarian cancer.

Suddenly, her focus was split between the kids and the cancer.

Unstructured playtime, surgery, healthy snacks, chemo.

Somebody's got to book the bounce house for the birthday party clinical trial research.

For about four years, it felt like we had the upper hand.

But then a bad scan.

I quit my job to help, which was not a hard decision.

Recurrent metastasized ovarian cancer has a very, very, very low survival rate.

But we fully believed that if we tried hard enough, we could be the outlier.

We weren't.

Liz died just over nine years ago.

Margot was 12, Gwen was 10, and Drew was eight.

At this point, my business card would have said single parent.

You know, before Liz died, I thought of all the things that parents did as a complete alphabet, A to Z.

And the way it worked in our family was I did A through M, kind of the blunt stuff, the job, paycheck, the tire pressure in the minivan.

Liz did N through Z, more nuanced, making sure like the kids, the dog, and me were looked after and happy.

After she died, I figured my job would simply be the the sum of the two, you know, the full A to Z.

Well, first of all, I completely underestimated how hard Liz's end of the alphabet was.

That N through Z.

I mean, six days after she died, all three kids got sent home from school with headlights.

We had been sleeping in the same room together, so it was a total mess.

U things got more routine, but they didn't get easier.

Three kids, two schools, five after school activities, just getting everybody to where they needed to be.

Permission slip, sunscreen, water bottle, both shoes.

I don't know how people did it.

But past the literal nitpicking and the logistics was the emotional dimension.

I mean, I knew my kids, but I didn't know them like Liz knew him.

I mean, how do you get to know a kid when they're changing so quickly?

You know, I I tried to keep current.

I I knew that Margot liked long sleeves.

Gwen does not like surprises.

And Drew doesn't always understand why underwear is necessary, but they kept evolving.

They kept evolving.

And so I finally just threw that away and adopted a new shoe, new kid program.

Oh, I see you've grown out of your shoes.

Nice to meet you.

Tell me everything I need to know about you.

So we we got there mostly enough only to realize this.

It's not just a toz.

There's a whole world beyond Z.

A world I didn't know existed.

Doing the routines, keeping up with the emotional evolutions only gets me into a position to discover this world beyond language.

And I got there with all my kids.

I'll give you an example.

10:30 at night, middle of nowhere, Vermont, drugstore.

Margot and I are staring at the wall of feminine products the first time she needed them.

Dumbfounded, completely confused.

And then we decided just to buy one of everything and cracked up laughing at the number of sizes and shapes and approaches.

Or the time with Gwen.

It looked like she was about to break down.

So I jump into mama bear mode thinking something went terribly wrong.

But then she burst into these tears of of joy and told me about something went unbelievably right.

or the after school pickup with Drew.

I'd done after school pickups close to 3,000 times.

So, he hops in the minivan, grabs his pretzels.

I notice that his lips are getting chapped, so I hand him the chapstick, the stuff that doesn't sting him, and he puts it on.

He's comforted.

He's home.

After a few minutes of quiet driving, we come to a red light and Drew goes, "Dad, what's your deepest desire?

Yeah, they weren't doing poems on deepest desire at school.

He just like came up with it.

I lock eyes with him.

My brain racing.

Quick, quick, quick, quick.

What's my deepest desire?

What a great learning moment.

Something I can say to change this kid's life.

I punted.

I don't know, Drew.

What's yours?

And at a red light on El Camino Rial, he said, "I want to feel love my entire life."

We stared at each other in silence uh until the light turned green.

My job was to pick up my kid from school.

My role on earth was to prove myself worthy for an invitation into that inner life, not the life I saw snowboarding or talking Pokemon and know that kid well enough to say the right enough thing.

You know, I wonder if I didn't do pickups all those times.

If he wasn't convinced that I would be there, if I knew him and his needs, would have he asked me that?

Who would have he asked?

All these times my kids were in this space like nervous system to nervous system.

It was beyond language.

We laughed or we cried or we stared at each other in silence not needing words to be together.

It was like fused in a neurological sense experiencing thinking feeling one thing as two people.

Now maybe some of you have experienced this.

I hadn't and I was trying But I learned a bunch and maybe there's some lessons there too for others.

For current A throughM parents, you know, if you find yourself tempted to daydream past or maybe outsource some seemingly mindless task with your kid, remember the routine can be the ticket to the transcendent.

For CEOs and technologists or anybody that's going to ask me now, how can you support parenting?

I'll let you know it's not about a easier path for logistics or some quicker path through the emotional evolutions.

You want to solve a harder problem, figure out how to enable more people to spend time in this world beyond letters and language.

You need some help, ask those N throughz people, the people who have felt it to they'll be your guide.

They'll let you know when you get it right.

So involve them in your process.

For me, the times that my kids and I spent in this empathy rich space, you know, cemented the idea for our family that bad things happen, pain, suffering, life's unfairnesses will happen.

But we are not alone.

And space time in this space, the connection feels so good, so whole.

I would do anything to be in the heart of it with my kids.

And I hope in time my kids will do anything to be in the heart of it with their kids.

Because once you know, you know.

In other words, I'll remember.

I'm looking forward to the birthdays and graduations.

But what will I treasure in my final days?

A locked in stare at a red light, tears of good news, and buying $150 worth of feminine products in the East Cow Path, Vermont.

Liz suspected I didn't understand all this when she died, and she was right.

Her fear was I' I'd never find it, and the kids would forever lose access to these sublime interactions that she had with them.

Those interactions, the last thing she could bear to give up in her final days.

It was her greatest sadness, but also a giant gift for me.

Paid for at the highest price that I will not squander.

This shared world beyond Z that I can now experience with my kids.

It's real.

It's pure.

And I know when we're there, they continue to feel their mother's love.

Thank you.
