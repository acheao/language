[Music]  When you've had a lot of opportunity  taken out of your community, you just  feel incredibly powerless.

You're not sure where to start.

You also  don't have the energy to figure out how  do you impact something like an economy.

Often what we really need is a new  imagination.

How do we create opportunities that can  root wealth and overturn these cycles of  generational poverty in our communities?

I'm Molly Himmstreet.

I'm the co-founder  and co-executive director of the  Industrial Commons and I work to bring  opportunity to rural communities across  southern Appalachia.

Appalachia for me is a really beautiful  place and it is where I call home.

I  always think the season I'm in is my  most favorite season.

There's lots and  lots of trees, animals, insects.

It's my  favorite place to be.

It's also a really  complex place.

A lot of the story of  Appalachia has been about extraction,  things leaving our communities.

Where I  grew up, we have been manufacturers and  makers for generations and particularly  textile manufacturing.

Textiles are really these workh horses  of our world.

It's not just the clothing  we wear.

If I think about the stint  that's in my dad's heart that's keeping  that heartbeating, that's a medical  textile.

If you think about a  firefighter that walks into a burning  building, they're protected by a  textile.

So much of our world is about  fiber and is about the textile industry.

And it's really our communities that are  helping to ensure that that industry  stays vibrant and active in the United  States.

But around the 1990s into the 2000s,  that work left,  leaving our communities with upwards of  15% unemployment.

Entire families just  didn't have work.

So I really started  asking this question of myself like what  do I do as someone who really wants to  stay here but someone who wants to be  sure that there's opportunity not just  for me and my family but for my friends  and neighbors.

There were several things that I wanted  to be different from what I had seen  coming down around me.

I wanted this to  be a profitable enterprise.

I wanted it  to be about people and I wanted to be  sure that we were making things that  weren't hurting the environment and I  knew that the people in my community had  incredible skill and incredible  knowledge and so Opportunity Threads was  started as an employeeowned company  around developing sustainable textiles.

The idea of employee ownership is just  really really basic and I think we can  all relate to it.

If we work really hard  for something, that reward should come  back to us.

We all want to feel like  we're valued.

We all want to feel like  the opportunity that we create, the  profits that we create, we have a say in  those.

Opportunity Threads is a really  magical place.

They're one of the  largest upycling facilities in the US,  upycling upwards of 60,000 t-shirts  every week.

They're a profitable  company, a really brilliant, bright  light in our community.

I'm very proud  of I'm proud of that work.

From there, I was like, "Oh, this is  kind of cool. This seems to be working. Let me find some more help."

I wasn't an  economist.

Didn't have a business major.

Didn't consider myself an entrepreneur.

What I did know is that I cared very  deeply about where I lived.

And so, we  started building a network.

We called it  the Carolina Textile District with this  whole idea of being big by being small  together.

So we were going to band  together in order to build scale.

And  then after we built that, we built the  industrial commons.

What we do with the  industrial commons is we support  workers.

We support businesses.

Some of  those businesses we help to buy and  convert to employeeowned companies.

Some  of those businesses we start ourselves.

We've drawn the attention of folks like  the National Science Foundation who have  chosen us as one of 10 innovation  communities across the country.

And it  was really the organization that I  needed when I was getting started that I  didn't have.

One of the projects that  the industrial commons right now is  working on is called material return.

And what we do at material return is we  take back the region's textile waste.

We  grind it up and we send it through this  big machine and then we're able to make  that back into a yarn.

Something that  might be sold for 3 cents a pound.

If we  can put it through our system, it can  come out on the other side and we can  sell it for $9 a pound.

So, we're  engineering value back into this waist  stream just like we're trying to  engineer opportunity back into our  communities.

Bob has really been the  leader that's helped material return get  started.

He's somebody that grew up in  Burke County, started to work when he  was 16 in a sawmill.

What's so neat  about Bob's story is, you know, Bob is  still working in manufacturing.

In fact,  he's working in these same plants where  his uncle and his dad used to work.

But  now he's an owner of that plant.

He has  a say in what's going to happen at that  facility and he's really one of the  leaders.

So Bob for me really represents  why I come to work every day.

We call  ourselves we're long haul people.

We're  in this for the long haul.

This isn't  just a project of 6 months.

This is a  project of of generations.

Right now,  there's 27,000 workers working in the  textile industry.

We would love to see  half of those workers engaged in some  type of enterprise or economic  opportunity that we're creating through  our ecosystem.

My hope is not just  southern Appalachia, but all over that  there's more say, there's more wealth  that can be rooted, there's less  extraction, and there's really just a  more thriving working class.

Every  community has opportunity.

Every  community has something good in it.

Every community has a future where you  can show up every day.

You can work  hard.

You can get ahead, but that's not  at the expense of the person beside you  getting ahead.

That there's  opportunities for your kids.

Where  there's a lightness and there's a joy  where you really feel like you're not  staying because you're forced to stay,  but you're staying because you've chosen  to stay.

We forget that we are part of  the economy.

We forget that we have  power in it.

It just takes a few people  to start and you don't have to  necessarily have a complex set of  skills.

What you really have to have is  a deep care and a deep love and a deep  knowledge of where you're planted and  where you want to grow.
