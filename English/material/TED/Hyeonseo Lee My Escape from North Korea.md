[Hyeonseo Lee: My Escape from North Korea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdxPCeWw75k)

When I was little,

I thought my country was the best on the planet,

and I grew up singing a song called "nothing to envy"

I was very proud.

We spent a lot of time in school

studying the history of Kim II-Sung,

but we didn't learn anything about the outside world

except that America, South Korea and Japan are enemies.

Although I was often curious about the outside world,

I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea,

until everything suddenly changed.

When I was 7 years old, I saw a public execution for the first time,

but I thought my life in North Korea was normal.

My family was not poor,

and I was never hungry.

But one day, in 1995, my mother brought home a letter

from a colleague's sister.

It was written, "when you read this letter, all 5 members of the family

will no longer be in this world,

because we have not eaten for the last 2 weeks.

We are lying all over the ground,

and our bodies are so weak that we are dying."  .  I was

speechless.

It was the first time I heard

that people in my country were suffering.

After a while, passing behind the train station,

I saw something terrible

that I can't get out of my mind.

A lifeless woman lying on the ground,

while a weak child in her arms

looked hopelessly in her face.

But no one helped them, because everyone was focused

on taking care of themselves and their families.

A major crisis befell North Korea in the mid-1990s.

Ultimately, more than 1 million North Koreans

died during the crisis, and many survived only

by eating grass, insects, and tree bark.

Power outages are becoming more and more frequent

and around me at night there was only darkness

except for the lights from China,

across the river behind my house.  I

always wondered why they had lights and we didn't.

This is a satellite image of North Korea at night

compared to its neighbors.

This is the Amrok River,

which serves as the border

between China and North Korea.

See, the river becomes very narrow

at some points, allowing the North Koreans to sneak across it.

But many die.

Sometimes I saw dead bodies floating along the river.  I

can't give too many details about how I left North Korea,

but I can say that during the terrible famine years

I went to China to live with distant cousins.

But I thought I

would be separated from my family only for a short time.  I

never imagined

that it would take 14 years to be back together.

In China it was difficult to live as a young girl without a family.  I did

n't know what life would be like

as a refugee from North Korea,

but I soon learned that it is not only difficult,

but also very dangerous,

because North Koreans in China are considered

illegal immigrants.

I lived in constant fear

that my identity would be revealed,

and I would be sent back to a terrible fate

in North Korea.

One day my worst dream came true

when I was caught by the Chinese police

and taken to the police station for questioning.

Someone had accused me of being from North Korea,

they tested my Chinese language skills

and asked me hundreds of questions.

I was so scared,

I thought my heart would explode.

If the slightest thing seemed fake, I would have been imprisoned

and repatriated.

I thought my life was over,

but I managed to control all the emotions inside me

and answered the questions.

After the questions were finished

one officer said to another

"That was a fake report.

She is not from North Korea."

And set me free.  It was a miracle.

Some North Koreans seek asylum in China

through foreign embassies,

but many are caught by the Chinese police

and repatriated.

These girls were lucky

that they were caught and

released

after a lot of international pressure.

These North Koreans did not have the same fate.

Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China

and repatriated

where they can be tortured, imprisoned

or publicly executed.

Although I was very lucky to get away,

many others were not so lucky.

It is tragic that North Korean women have to hide their identity

and fight so hard to survive.

Even after learning a new language and starting a job,

their lives can be turned upside down in an instant.

And that's why after 10 years of hiding my identity,

I decided to take a risk by going to South Korea,

and started a new life.

Settling in South Korea turned out to be more difficult

than I expected.

English was very important in South Korea,

so I started learning a third language.

I realized that there was a big difference

between North and South.

We are all Korean, but inside,

we have become very different

during 67 years of separation.  I

also went through an identity crisis.  Am I from

North Korea or South Korea?  Where do

I come from?  Who am I?

Suddenly there was no country

to be proud of.

Although it wasn't easy to create a life in South Korea

I had a plan.  I

started studying to enter the university.

Just as I was getting used to my new life,

I received a shocking phone call last night.  The

North Korean authorities

had discovered that I had sent my family some money,

and as punishment my family would be

forcibly transferred

to a lost village.

They had to leave soon,

and I began to think of ways to help them escape.

North Koreans have to travel a long

way for freedom.

It is almost impossible to cross the border

between North and South Korea,

so I bought a ticket to China

and headed to the North Korean border.

Since my family didn't speak Chinese,

I had to somehow guide them

over 2,000 miles to China

and back to Southeast Asia.  The

bus journey lasted 1 week,

and many times we risked getting caught.

Once our bus stopped

and a Chinese officer got on.

He checked every ID card,

and started asking questions.

My family did not speak Chinese

and I thought they would be arrested.

As soon as the officer approached my family, I

immediately stood up and told them

that this is a group of deaf-mute people

that I was accompanying.

He looked at me suspiciously,

but luckily he believed me.

We made it all the way to the border in Laos,

but I spent almost all my money

bribing the guards in Laos.

But even after we crossed the border,

my family was arrested and put in jail

for illegal border crossing.

After paying the fine and bribe money,

my family was released after a month,

but after a while they were arrested and imprisoned again

in the capital of Laos.

This was one of the lowest points in my life.

I did everything to free my family,

and we were so close to that point,

but my family was thrown back into prison

very close to the South Korean embassy..

I went up and down from the immigration office

to the police station

trying desperately to get him.  freed my family

but I didn't have enough money

to pay fines or bribes.

I lost all hope

At that moment, I heard a man's voice asking me,

"What happened?"

I was surprised

that a stranger cared and asked me.

With little English and a dictionary

I explained the situation to him, and without hesitation the

gentleman went to the ATM

and paid the change for my family

and 2 other North Koreans to be released from prison.

I thanked him with all my heart, and asked,

"Why are you helping me?"

"I'm not helping you," he said.

"I'm helping people from North Korea."

This was a symbolic moment for my life.

The unknown ignited new hopes in me

and the people of North Korea when I needed it most,

it showed me that the kindness of strangers

and the help of the international community

are really the rays that we North Koreans need.

In the end, after the long journey,

my family and I joined South Korea,

but freedom is half the battle.

Many North Koreans are separated from their families,

and when they arrive in a new country

they start with little or no money.

So we can benefit from the international community

for education, English language courses,

work courses and others.

We can also be a link

for people in North Korea

and the outside world.

because some of us are in contact with

family members still inside the country,

sending money and information

to help change North Korea from the inside.  I

have been lucky to have been given so much help

and inspiration in life,

so I want to help give North Koreans

a chance to grow

with international support.

I'm sure you will see many, many

successful North Koreans around the world,

even on the TED stage.

Thank you.

(Applause)
