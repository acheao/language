I'm excited to present a new way
to design 3D games with AI.
Now, many of you may have used AI
to produce text or images or even code,
but 3D, with that extra dimension,
is incredibly hard.
So today, in the next few minutes,
you and I are going to create
a playable 3D game
in Roblox,
that the world has never seen before,
because we are going
to imagine it together
and use AI to build it.
Now these are super early days,
but let's see what AI can do.
OK.
I'm going to prompt to create
an Asian village in winter.
So how about
a stylized Japanese village
village in winter.
Maybe a central pagoda.
A few houses with pine trees around it.
Maybe a traditional red gate and lanterns.
Some prompts.
So when I say generate, what happens is
an AI model takes this prompt,
analyzes it,
and produces the code
that you see on the right.
This is all happening live.
And what it's doing
is it's transforming that prompt
into spatial boxes
where the objects are going to land.
So that's the location
of the different objects.
And soon you'll see,
behind me, in my avatar,
the objects transforming
into their shapes,
and then the textures.
These are all happening live.
So while this is all happening,
I need your help
to help me build this out.
So what would you guys want
to add to this scene?
What did you say?
Wolves, OK.
Add a wolf.
Let me do an anime ...
a cute wolf --
(Laughter)
Near me.
How about some vehicles?
Snowmobile, OK.
A snowmobile.
And a few ...
(Audience: Palm trees!)
Oh, palm trees, OK, wow.
Near the gate.
OK.
A palm tree, somebody said?
Palm tree next to the house, maybe.
And a Santa?
(Laughter)
How about something else?
(Laughter)
OK, a few animals.
A few animals next to the trees, OK.
Alright, that's good enough.
We get a sense of it.
So while this is happening,
let me show you what we've built so far.
So right off the bat,
you can see how this --
it got the the overall aesthetic
of the scene, right.
You know, everything fits well globally.
It got the environment,
got the background.
It got the pagoda
to be the tallest structure.
You have these houses next to it
and you have the trees behind.
So all of that sounds good.
But I see my friend Maurice
joining in from California.
He's also watching this live
and say, "Hi, Maurice."
Isn't it fun to basically connect,
build and play with friends?
This is the whole point of this thing.
So obviously he's excited.
Oh wow, look at some
of these things it's created.
So the one interesting thing is
if you don't like something,
you can just move it around.
So I'm going to move this object.
It's a huge truck.
Well let's move it away.
Obviously this is the fun
of doing the live demos.
And then let's take a look
at all the things it created.
Oh, I see this fox here or a wolf, right,
the cute anime wolf.
Let's see.
Come back here.
Let's take a look at you.
OK, well, let's move you here.
What do you guys think?
(Applause)
Well, unlike images,
because this is a 3D world,
we can build on a game engine.
We can add effects to it.
So you can actually make
this much more immersive.
Maybe I can make it snow
because it's the winter village,
so you'll start seeing snow in a second.
And in addition to creating objects,
the AI model can also produce code
to make these objects functional.
So I can actually go up to this car
or maybe let me try this snowmobile
and it lets me ride it.
So if I press this, I can kind of
go around and ride it around
and you can see how
this can get really cool.
And I'm sure Maurice is going
to do some fun driving around.
Look at that, he's already there.
(Laughter)
OK, Maurice, take it easy.
One last thing I'd like to show you
is with these worlds,
I love seeing them
at different times of the day,
so I can switch it around,
I can make it into sunset.
Or actually I can see it at night.
And night, it's kind of really cool
because you start seeing
the moon and the sky.
But another thing that happens is see
how these lanterns that we added,
they start lighting up.
And this is another
example of the functionality
which we call 4D, that the model adds.
So it knows that the lanterns emit light.
And so it makes them, you know, lit.
So these are some of the things
that you can do,
which bring a scene to life.
And let me switch back to day.
And the lights turn off.
Anyway, I could be doing this
all day long with you guys,
but sadly, I think I'm out of time.
Hopefully you guys had a preview
of the transformative power of AI for 3D.
We think this is the future of 3D gaming.
Thank you.
(Applause)
