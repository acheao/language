So when I think about confidence,
I first ground myself in the definition.
Confidence is just the reliance
or assurance that we believe
in someone's abilities or qualities.
But how do we know
someone's abilities or qualities?
How does anyone believe in mine?
It's simply through actions.
So the best way
to drive and build confidence,
whether we’re looking to hone it
or build a reputation for it
or encourage people to have it in us,
is to drive action.
Interestingly, many people
think you need a lot of confidence
to take bold action.
I think the opposite is true.
It’s action. Just getting
comfortable with it over time.
Doing more and better regularly.
It's reps of action that drive confidence.
And that action, and that confidence
is what allows us to learn and grow.
I'm someone who wants to continue
to learn and grow.
No matter how old I get,
how many successes or challenges,
how long I've been in a role or company,
I want to get better.
And you’re here, so I know you do, too.
So the question is,
what techniques or practices
can help us cut through the challenges
that are in our way to acting our way
to confidence and growth.
Many people believe
some of the best actions are
when we show up in tough times,
and that's true.
But it's almost easier
to take bold action when things are hard.
There aren't a lot of options.
The more special muscle is the ability
to coach ourselves to be greater,
to do more, to be better,
even when times are pretty good,
and to recognize that complacency
is a very real thing,
and we are all blinded
by our own progress.
So one of the tools in my toolbox
to drive action and confidence and growth
is the ability to cut through
that complacency.
And I first learned
this lesson from my mom.
When I was nine years old,
my mom came to me and said,
"That's it, I'm done. We're leaving."
And what she meant was
we were leaving my father.
My father was and is a very good man.
But at the time, he was an alcoholic
and a terrible husband and father.
So when my mom came to me
at the age of nine,
I didn’t cry, and I didn’t get upset.
I remember thinking,
"What took you so long?
Finally, it's about time."
So often there are people around us
just waiting on us to take the action,
to do the thing, to do the right thing.
And since then, I've been inspired
to have practices
that drive action over and over.
Little ones every day, or bigger ones,
like what my mom did that day.
We did leave my dad.
My mom fed us on a meager food budget,
worked multiple jobs for many years,
and over the course of my young life,
I got to see her day-to-day example.
Someone without resources,
without a playbook.
She had no coach. She had no one
to mentor her through this experience.
She just acted her way
to growth and improvement over time.
As a result of this childhood,
I started working at a very young age.
At 15, I worked in malls.
At 17, I was a restaurant hostess,
at 18, a waitress.
At 19, I began my leadership journey,
opening franchises around the world.
By the age of 26, I was an executive
in a very large company.
And while I had fantastic
supervisors and managers
who helped me through my career,
I lacked some of that
outside-in perspective.
The mentoring, the things that could help
stretch me beyond my day-to-day job.
So I started developing
some self-coaching practices.
And one day I heard
from a restaurant consultant
that you should sometimes imagine
someone else in your role
to help motivate you to take action.
So I started doing that, and it helped.
So I started thinking
about people I admired,
someone specific,
and there was something
about thinking of someone I admired
that brought this element
of additional capabilities and excellence.
It also made me feel a little accountable
to act on whatever came to mind.
And these practices evolved
into today what is the “hot shot rule.”
The hot shot rule is simply this.
It is the act of regularly thinking
about my role, everything I have,
the challenges, the opportunities,
envisioning someone I admire in my role,
asking myself what's one thing
that person I admire would do differently
to make that situation better,
acting on it within 24 hours,
and then -- that's not the last step --
telling those involved
once things get put in motion.
I say something like,
"Hey, I could have or should have
done this thing, but I didn't.
And now we are..."
And so let's practice it.
So I think first of my role as a mother.
I think of how I can be a better mom.
I think of my role as daughter.
I think of how I can be a better daughter,
and I envision someone I admire.
But often, and we're here
to talk about work,
I think about my professional role.
So I think about my role as CEO of AG1.
I have this incredible opportunity
to be the leader
of a phenomenal, foundational
nutrition company
with millions of customers who rely on us
to empower their health journeys,
and so many team members
who rely on me to be my best.
Our customers and my team
deserve for me to be the best over time.
Not comfortable because
we've had multiple years of success,
but always starting
with that day one energy.
Then I envision someone I admire.
So I just met all of you,
I think of you.
Now I envision you in my seat tomorrow.
I’m gone, and I’m just
watching you in my role.
And I ask, what's one thing
and the first thing
you would do differently
to make the business better?
And something comes to mind,
something actionable.
I take action on it within 24 hours,
and then once it's in motion,
I tell my team.
Practicing the hot shot rule over time
has led to things like
flying to meet a business partner
to hold them accountable
when I had made excuses for them.
Or calling someone to apologize
or acknowledge a situation
I could have handled
better or differently.
It's led to me thinking about someone
who has recently lost
a parent or a loved one
and envisioning them in my role.
And it’s led to me
just picking up the phone
and calling my mom, and saying,
“I love you, and how are you?”
It's led to me saying "thank you"
to my husband for being a great partner.
It's also led to me
stopping initiatives in the company
that I was allowing to perpetuate
because things were just comfortable,
but they were no longer
serving the business.
So that’s what the hot shot rule is.
And you can use it as a technique
in a time of need anytime.
But its power lies in it being
a regular, proactive practice.
It used to be quarterly and then monthly,
but now I practice it weekly.
Every Sunday at 1pm,
when my kids, now five and seven,
used to have naps --
RIP naps --
(Laughter)
I take just a minute for myself.
I envision my role,
I envision someone I admire.
I ask myself, what's one thing
they would do differently in my role.
The answer comes to mind.
I send the email, I schedule the flight,
I put it in motion,
and then once it's in motion,
I tell my team.
And over a year of practicing this weekly,
a few things will happen.
One, there are 52 things you've done
that you otherwise might not have done
or done as quickly.
It builds a reputation
of vulnerability and bias for action.
My team brings things to me now
because they know
I'm constantly calling myself out.
This practice has changed my life,
and I believe it will change yours
if you apply it.
The idea of having a practice
of reflection, intention and action
to drive growth,
to show up and do something
we otherwise wouldn’t have,
to break through complacency
or past patterns is a superpower.
So be like my mom.
Don't let patterns of the past
get in the way
of doing something different tomorrow.
Ask questions that help motivate action.
And act your way
into growth and confidence.
Thank you.
(Applause)
