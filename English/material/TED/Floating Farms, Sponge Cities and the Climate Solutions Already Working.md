I'm a climate justice advocate,
and people often ask me,
"Harjeet, how do you manage
to stay positive and smile
with all the doom and gloom around us?"
Trust me, I do get angry
and there's plenty of evidence online.
(Laughter)
There is no doubt that we are living
through a human-caused climate crisis.
But I have immense faith in humanity
and our collective superpower,
which is our ability to adapt.
We have adapted for centuries,
except the scale and speed
that are required now are unprecedented,
and each one of us has to play our part.
Let me share about Kamlesh
Kushwaha's superpower.
He's an organic farmer
from a drought-prone
Bundelkhand region in India,
where people are dependent on rain
fed agriculture and traditional wells.
Having worked with Kamlesh since 2017
through my organization,
Satat Sampada,
I can tell you he's not
a conventional farmer.
He's someone who thinks,
who plans, who knows how to adapt.
Life could have been far worse
for him during the deadly 2024 heatwave,
but his ability to choose crops wisely
and adjust the timings
as the weather changes,
and installing a solar-powered
irrigation pump
with the government support,
has been a game changer.
He has been able to adapt
much better than many farmers,
who lost close to 50 percent
of their production.
Kamlesh's story is not
just about survival,
it's about the human spirit.
It's about power of people
to make a difference
if they get the right kind of support
and in a timely manner.
We know that climate impacts
are increasing
and we see devastation all around us,
which means that we have to adapt.
So what is adaptation?
Adaptation means adjusting
and being ready for a new climate reality,
which is uncertain and unpredictable.
Let me make it simple for you.
Imagine you are stepping out
of home wearing a T-shirt,
carrying a water bottle for the heat,
but you're also carrying an umbrella
for the unexpected rain
and a jacket for the evening chill.
It may look a bit silly,
but then you are ready
for every situation.
That's personal adaptation.
Countries, of course,
require much more than a backpack.
Let me share a mantra with you,
which is the crux of my 25 years
of experience working with communities,
governments and also
at the global policy-making level.
The mantra is
that there can be no adaptation
without development.
Let's unpack.
Take two coastal nations.
One, the Netherlands,
where centuries of investment
and smart planning
have created a landscape
that can coexist with the sea.
The other, Bangladesh,
where millions of people live
on the front lines of climate change
where floods, droughts,
cyclones and rising seas are devastating
their homes, farms and livelihoods.
This isn't just about geography,
it's about access to resources.
Netherlands, for instance,
amassed massive wealth
largely through its colonial rule.
Bangladesh, on the other hand,
has been a victim
of such historical injustices.
Economist Utsa Patnaik's research,
published by Columbia University Press,
reveals how the British took
approximately 45 trillion dollars
from the Indian subcontinent
between 1765 to 1938.
Now imagine the scale of the wealth
that was taken from the subcontinent,
which pushed the region into deep poverty,
limiting the capacity
of nations like Bangladesh
to invest into resilient infrastructure
and institutions that are required now
to deal with the climate impacts.
Like Bangladesh, we also see
countries like Mozambique,
which are facing devastating
climate impacts.
They are forced to take
more and more loans
and the result is they are stuck
and trapped in a vicious cycle of debt
and poverty.
Lesson: there can be no adaptation
without development.
Let's also not think
that only low-income countries
are facing climate impacts.
Remember the floods
in Germany a few years ago?
Wildfires in Australia
and Canada, even now?
And the super storms that are hitting
the US far more frequently.
All these are challenging and overwhelming
the capacity of these nations
who have robust power grids,
emergency services, warning systems.
But the fact is that they are losing
billions of dollars.
You must be asking why?
Why them?
Because they never anticipated
that the climate crisis
is also going to hit them.
I've been following
negotiations for years.
They always thought
it's a developing-country issue.
On the contrary, they kept increasing
the fossil fuel extraction,
which we all know is the cause
of the climate crisis.
I'm talking about coal, oil and gas.
Lesson: if you donâ€™t adapt,
climate impacts are going
to erode years of development gains.
And more fossil fuels
means more climate impacts,
leading to more losses and damages.
Now, that was the heavy part.
(Laughter)
Let's talk about some good news.
Studies from the Global
Commission on Adaptation
and the World Resources Institute
have shown that for every dollar
invested in adaptation,
we can save four to more than 10 dollars
that are later spent on disaster response.
That's an amazing return
on investment, right?
So there's a very strong economic case
to invest in adaptation now
for a safer future.
Let's take some more examples
from the grassroots, cities
and at the policy level.
Let me take you back to Bangladesh,
where we see that farms
are flooded for months.
What does that mean?
No crops, no food.
But I have seen it myself,
how many farmers in Bangladesh
have created these floating farms.
Have you heard of that?
They use a local bamboo material
with rich beds of soil and compost.
So when flood waters rise,
these farms float,
lifting the produce
safely above the water.
How brilliant is that?
So your farms learn to swim.
There are also examples
of cities where you see
that Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia,
Shanghai and Tianjin in China
and Singapore have decided
to become sponge cities.
Instead of fighting excess water,
they are working to make friends with it.
What does that mean?
It means more green spaces,
like porous pavements
that can absorb rainwater,
more parks, more urban wetlands
and more rooftop gardens.
So what's the impact?
They are not only prepared
to fight floods much better.
These aspects also
clean the air naturally,
they also cool down the neighborhoods,
making the city far more pleasant
and healthy for everyone.
Now let's also look at the policy level.
One of the largest climate-adaptation
initiatives in Africa,
Productive Safety Net
Programme in Ethiopia,
doesn't just provide
food aid during droughts,
but engages millions of people
to create soil and water
conservation structures,
small irrigation projects
and also revive degraded lands.
Now, that's a masterpiece of common sense.
You are using the resource
which is there for immediate relief
to invest into long-term
adaptation and resilience.
But that would require
hundreds of billions of dollars.
So what you and I can do?
Two things.
One, we must make sure
that all countries have
resilience policies and practices
so that we are able to adapt.
And we also need to move
away from fossil fuels.
And that would require a bolder initiative
so that we can all make a transition
which is just and equitable.
And for that, we need
a fossil fuel treaty.
(Applause)
And we also need to make sure
that developing countries,
who do not have resources,
are supported by the wealthy nations
who are largely responsible
for the climate crisis.
They have an outsized responsibility.
Second,
beyond governments,
you can use your adaptation superpower
to make a difference,
and you don't need to be
a climatologist for that.
If you are an educator,
don't just teach about climate change,
but also prepare and inspire
the next generation to act.
If you are an engineer,
you can be the Tony Stark of adaptation.
Innovate, create designs and technology
and share them with people
who need to manage climate risks.
If you are an artist or a content creator,
simplify complex data and concepts.
Write a poem, sing a song.
Reach people's hearts and minds
so that they can learn
about resilience with joy and hope.
Let us start accepting the reality
that climate change is upon us,
and it has brought uncertainty
and unpredictability on a daily basis.
We need to apply a climate
lens to every activity
so that we can make adaptation
and development go hand in hand.
And trust me, collectively,
we can build a safer future
by spreading solutions
and hope everywhere.
Thank you.
(Applause)
