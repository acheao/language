So let me ask you a question.
How many of you do your banking,
your health care on your phones?
Right, of course you do.
How about like, your love life,
your entertainment,
travel planning, all that kind of stuff?
Right.
How many of you vote on your phones?
That's the problem.
So I spent the first 15 years of my career
working in US government and politics.
City government, state government,
federal government, you name it,
I saw it from pretty much every angle.
And the main thing
that I took away from it,
really, more than anything else,
is why politicians make
the decisions they make.
Is it based on what they believe in?
No.
Is it what's best for their city
or their state or their country?
Not really.
How about what's best
for their constituents specifically?
Not even that.
It's actually a lot simpler.
Virtually every politician
makes every decision
solely based on winning the next election
and nothing else.
And that's true for the next election
and then the next election after that.
(Applause)
And it's a problem in democracies
all over the world,
but it's especially pervasive
in the United States
because we have this corrupt practice
known as gerrymandering.
And what that allows
the two political parties to do
is divvy up all the legislative districts
so that, as a result,
the only election that ever
really matters is the party primary.
Now we had a big election last fall.
You guys might have heard
something about it.
And in that election,
about two thirds of Americans voted.
But that was for president.
I live in New York City.
In 2023, we had city council primaries.
Turnout was 7.2 percent.
So I don't know if you guys
have ever been to New York,
but if you have, you will know,
we are not a shy people.
And yet, in this city
of 8.5 million highly opinionated people,
you could win a council seat
with just 8,000 votes.
And the same thing is true
in state legislative races,
congressional, mayoral,
you name it, and it's true everywhere.
So who are those voters?
They're typically
the far right or the far left,
or special interests that know
how to move money and votes
in low-turnout elections.
They dictate not only who wins office
but then what happens
once they're in office.
And that gets us one
of two types of government.
Either the chaos and dysfunction
that we call Washington, DC,
or totally one-sided governments,
whether it's the state
of Texas on the right
or the city of San Francisco on the left.
And if we were truly hopelessly divided,
if we just couldn't agree on any issue,
that'd be one thing, but we're not.
Most people agree
on the solutions to most issues,
whether it's education
or health care or climate or taxes
or let's take guns as an example.
The vast majority of Americans would say
that we should neither
confiscate everyone's guns,
but nor should it be easy
to walk into a store
and walk out with an assault rifle.
But the problem is, those Americans,
the people in the center,
the people in the middle,
they don't vote in primaries.
So politicians ignore their views
and cater only to the extremes.
And when the next school shooting happens,
and it will happen,
all of us are going to bang
our heads against the wall and say,
Why can’t our politicians
just do the right thing for once?”
Why?
I'll tell you why.
Because they're held
hostage by the extremes.
They're stuck.
We have to free them from their clutches.
We have to make it possible
for them to move back to the middle.
And the only way to do that
is to get a lot more people voting.
And the only way to do that
is to meet the people where they are:
on their phones.
About a decade or so ago,
I helped run a lot of the campaigns
around the US to legalize Uber.
And I know that now
when you guys think of Uber,
it's this giant corporation.
But back then, we were a tiny
little tech startup,
and taxi was this big,
politically powerful industry
who really didn't like us.
And we knew we couldn’t out-muscle them.
And so instead, we turned to the people.
And by making it possible
for our customers
to tell their elected officials,
"Hey, I like this Uber thing,
please leave it alone,"
we were able to mobilize
millions of people through the app
to advocate on our behalf.
And when mayors and city council members
started hearing from thousands
of their constituents,
that's exactly what they did.
They left Uber alone.
It's how we won at basically
every market in the country.
And while this was happening,
I just remember sitting there thinking,
"God bless these people.
They're making my job a lot easier."
But my guess is they don't know
who their city council member is.
They don't vote in state Senate primaries.
And you know, why would they?
They're busy, they have kids,
they have jobs, they have lives.
But when we made it really easy,
when we let people reach their politicians
directly from their phones,
everything changed.
So what if we could vote this way?
So in 2017, we created
the Mobile Voting Project.
And the first thing we did was work
with election officials in seven states,
red and blue,
where either deployed military
or people with disabilities
were able to vote
in real elections on their phones.
Soldiers from West Virginia
stationed in Afghanistan.
People who are blind in Denver.
In one election in Seattle,
we let everyone participate.
And after doing it for two years in a row,
turnout tripled.
Denver did a poll of those
who participated in their election,
and 100 percent,
so every single respondent,
said, "Yeah, I like pressing a button
better than having to go somewhere."
Shocking, right?
In other big news, water is wet,
and ice cream tastes good.
(Laughter)
But that was for specific
groups of voters.
And we wanted everyone to be able
to vote securely on their phones.
So four years ago,
we started building our own
mobile voting technology.
We're almost done,
we're going to finish it this summer.
And when we do, it's going to be free
and open-source to any government
in the world that wants to use it.
And to be clear, this is just
an additional way to vote.
If you like voting by mail, vote by mail.
If you like voting in person,
great, do that.
Some people really like the ceremony
that comes with going somewhere
and waiting in line and all of that.
And if that happens to be you,
knock yourself out.
But based on turnout,
that's not most of you.
So let's give people another option.
So as I mentioned before,
and as you can probably tell
from my accent, I'm from New York,
so I'm going to use that
as the example for how it works.
I go on the App Store, and I download
the New York City Board of Elections app.
And the first thing they do is say, OK,
is Bradley really a registered voter
here in New York City?
I put in my address.
Fine.
Next thing is multi-factor authentication.
So you know how, like,
when you forget your Google password,
they send you a code
and you put it back into the app?
Same thing here.
Then we take a scan of your face,
match that up against your government ID.
And at this point we've fully established,
OK, Bradley is really Bradley.
Ballot pops up on my screen,
and the ballot itself
is simple and easy to use,
and I go through it,
I take my time, no rush.
Whenever I'm ready, I hit submit.
And when I hit submit,
three things happen.
First, my ballot is encrypted.
Second, it's anonymized.
Third, I get a tracking code,
like if it were a FedEx package,
so I can track the progress of my ballot
all the way through the process.
Then it goes back to the New York City
Board of Elections, and they air-gap it,
which means they take it offline.
And once my ballot is no longer
connected to the internet,
then they decrypt it,
a paper copy is printed out
that gets mixed in
with all of the other ballots.
I know where my ballot stands,
because I can see from the tracking code
that it was received, tabulated,
printed and so on.
And the underlying code
itself is open source,
which means that anyone can audit it.
Anyone can verify it.
It's totally transparent.
To me, that's a lot more secure
than the way we vote right now.
And we've already built it.
We've already paid for it,
and we're giving it away
to anyone who wants to use it for free.
(Applause and cheers)
And with a little more work,
I think we could do even more.
We could register people
to vote on the app.
We could give voters
nonpartisan information
about candidates or ballot measures
so you actually know
what you're voting on.
And versions of this already do exist.
Mobile voting in a way, exists in Estonia.
They use it in party elections in the UK.
Some municipalities here in Canada use it.
But not in the US,
and not in most democracies.
And that's where
the hard part really kicks in:
getting politicians to let us use
our phones to vote in elections,
because in my experience,
people in power don't like
making it easier
for other people to gain power.
And that's --
Yeah, exactly.
(Applause)
And that's why I'm here.
Because they're not just
going to do it if I ask nicely.
They're not just going to do it
if I snarl at libertarians on X
or at the liberals on Bluesky.
They're only going to do it
if you make it happen.
If we all make it happen.
And we can.
Every major right that has ever
been won, anywhere:
the right to vote,
the Civil Rights Act,
the Americans with Disabilities Act,
same-sex marriage, anything,
has only happened because enough people
stood up loud enough
and long enough and demanded their rights,
and eventually the status quo
had to give in.
And we can do that here, too.
We can make voting easier
and a lot more secure.
We can bring regular people
back into the process.
We can take power away from the extremes.
We can end the dysfunction
and polarization
that plagues our society today.
We can give our politicians the cover
and the courage they need
to work together and to finally,
finally get things done.
We can do all of this
in the next ten years.
We can do it with mobile voting.
Thank you.
(Applause and cheers)
